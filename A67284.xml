            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

With the more favour and kindneſs, in my thoughts, are <hi>their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> preciſely conſidered as ſuch, to be treated; and with the more fairneſs and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ought <hi>thoſe Endeavours,</hi> which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for the removal of their Prejudiees, to be managed. And this may be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Account for that <hi>Prolixity,</hi> which ſome may think there is, and for that <hi>Plainneſs,</hi> which I have ſtudied there ſhould be, in theſe enſuing Papers: eſpecially if I ſhall add thereto this Conſideration, that the Perſons lying under theſe Prejudices, and whoſe reſcue from under the captivity of Errour, is the wiſh of all good Chriſtians, are moſtly ſuch, as are to be ſpoke to in Vulgar language, and Familiar ſpeech, as
<pb facs="tcp:97369:4"/> not having had thoſe advantages of a <hi>learned education,</hi> which ſhould make them capable to ſound the depths of profound perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, unravel the windings of intricate diſcourſes, and keep pace in underſtanding, with a high tide of big words, and a rolling torrent of ſtrong lines: in which way <hi>to him that ſpeaketh they will be but as Barbarians, and he that ſpeaketh ſhall be but a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence by the way I ſhall take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to admoniſh thoſe that read Books onely for the elegance of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and cannot reliſh the wholſome food of ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

            <p>And further to prevent any man's ſinning againſt God, by raſhly judging or uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably cenſuring me about the quorations in theſe Papers, which are many, and large; I declare that my ends in making them were to give <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>credit</hi> to the cauſe I maintain, by ſhewing it eſpouſed by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of reputation for learning and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their ſeveral ages; and to free my ſelf from the imputation of <hi>novelty,</hi> and <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity</hi> in any thing maintained by me; and that I made them ſo large partly to <hi>prevent ſuſpicion of inſincerity</hi> in my dealings, and partly to <hi>furniſh ſome with appoſite teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> Who may not have thoſe conveniences of conſulting Authors that I have had.</p>

So that the Readers which do not like of all may pleaſe themſelves with what they have moſt fancy too, leaving the liberty which themſelves make uſe of, unto others; who as being of different taſts may think their leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as good as their takings, and reliſh that beſt which they diſreliſh moſt.</p>
            <p>And becauſe there is no one Prejudice that holds a ſtronger poſſeſſion of our <hi>Antipae</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97369:6"/> 
               <hi>dobaptiſts,</hi> than that which ariſes from that bright evidence, which they have, of <hi>the baptizing Adult Perſons</hi> in all the Ages of the Church, and of <hi>many's deferring</hi> either <hi>to be baptized Themſelves,</hi> or <hi>to baptize their Infants,</hi> in ſeveral Ages of it, and thoſe eſpecially that were neareſt to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times; and the removal of that Prejudice may be a fair Introduction to their depoſiting of all the reſt, therefore I will endeavour, in my entrance, to remove that. And if I can ſhew that the <hi>Delays of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,</hi> which they ſo ſpeak of, in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, <hi>were upon other Grounds,</hi> and <hi>on different Accounts</hi> from thoſe that our <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> alledge in the caſe, then that plea of theirs from the practice of <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing Adult Perſons,</hi> and <hi>deferring the Baptiſm of Infants,</hi> will neither ſerve their Hypotheſis, nor diſſerve ours.</p>
            <p>The Grounds, as I underſtand, on which our <hi>Antipaedobaptiſt</hi> refuſe to baptize their Infants, and defer their baptizing to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Age, are becauſe, as they ſuppoſe, there is <hi>no command</hi> in Scripture for it; And becauſe there is no example in Scripture of it; either of which if there found, they would hold it lawfull; and becauſe they find nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them there, they hold it unlawfull.</p>
            <p>Now if it appear that <hi>the unlawfulneſs</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97369:6"/> 
               <hi>to baptize Infants,</hi> for want of a Scripture command or Example for it, <hi>was none of the Grounds on which the Ancients did defer their baptizing,</hi> and that never any ſuch thing was in the Primitive Times pretended or pleaded by any, to juſtifie or excuſe that delay, then I hope the caſe will be clear, that their delays of Baptiſm on other Grounds, can aſford no protection to the Hypotheſis our <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts,</hi> who deny Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm to Infants, upon the Account of the unlawfulneſs of it.</p>
            <p>That <hi>never any ſuch pretence</hi> or plea was <hi>made by any in the primitive times</hi> (even for five hundred years) <hi>against Infants Baptiſm</hi> I rationally preſume, becauſe I ſee none yet produced by any of the Learnedſt of our <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts,</hi> who have, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſearch'd through, and through, all the writings of the Fathers, and Primitive Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, and ranſack'd every page, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled every paſſage in them, for ſome patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage to their Hypotheſis. And as they are <hi>quick ſighted enough</hi> to have eſpied it, ſo they would have been <hi>carefull enough,</hi> if there had been any, to have produced it.</p>
            <p>And <hi>upon the moſt curious ſearch,</hi> that I have been able to make for it my ſelf, as far as the circumſtances I am under would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me, I ſincerely profeſs, <hi>I have not been</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97369:7"/> 
               <hi>able to find any.</hi> What I have found <hi>urged,</hi> or but <hi>binted</hi> at, as a ground or reaſon for any ones delaying either his own, or any Infants baptizing, I ſhall fairly give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, and then leave the Reader to judge, what advantage our pleaders againſt Infants Baptiſm upon the account of the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it can make therefrom; or rather what a miſerable fallacy they put upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others, whileſt they alledge the Primitive Practice of deferring Infants Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, in juſtification of their denying Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm to Infants, upon the account of the unlawfulneſs of it for want of a Command or Example in Scripture, whereas it was <hi>never in the Primitive Times denied to any Infant upon that account;</hi> nor was that ground ever urged or alledged by any in thoſe days, as a reaſon, or ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for their deferring to baptize their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; nor did any ask, as our Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts now do, <hi>What Scripture have you for it? Where did Chriſt ever command it?</hi> or <hi>where did any Apoſtle practice it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in order to the ſhewing on what Accounts Baptiſm was in <hi>Ancient Times</hi> ſo oft, and ſo long deferred, I muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that ſome did voluntarily defer their own baptizing; and ſome had their Baptiſm deferred by others; the former were <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97369:7"/> the later <hi>Infants.</hi> And of the <hi>Reaſons</hi> or <hi>Occaſions</hi> of both I will ſpeak diſtinctly.</p>

            <p>(19) Laſtly, if I may have leave to conjecture, ſome forbore being baptized out of <hi>fear of perſecution</hi> for their Religion. How probably this is conjectured will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, when it is conſidered how difficult, or rather impoſſible it was for any in thoſe days, under perſecuting Tyrants, to hold or enjoy any place of power, profit, or honour, either in Court, City, or Army, or even life it ſelf, that was known to be a Chriſtian; and how ready an expedient it was towards the holding of ſuch places, and enjoying life and liberties, and avoiding all perſecution upon the ſcore of Chriſtianity, by remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unbaptized; ſince they could not be proved Chriſtians, that were never chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened. And now having ſhown the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why ſeveral above the Age of Infants did themſelves delay their own baptizing, it follows ſecondly that I ſhew upon what Reaſons the baptizing of children in their Infancy was delayed by others.</p>
            <p>Now to this it may be ſaid in <hi>General,</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:97369:16"/> it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that on what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the Adult delayed to be baptized themſelves, on the ſame they delayed the baptizing of their children, (unleſs where the caſe was altered by ſome particularity of circumſtance); and ſo it came to paſs that the baptizing of many Infants was deſerred till they came to riper years.</p>
            <p>But there are further more <hi>Particular</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to be given of the delaying of Infants, more nearly relating unto them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſome were as yet <hi>Heathens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> unconverted to Chriſtianity, when their children were born: and no marvel if they would not make their children Chriſtians, who themſelves were Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. And the ſame is the caſe of ſuch as, though in heart and purpoſe Chriſtians when their children were born, yet kept off from being baptized.</p>

            <p>And now ſo many <hi>reaſons</hi> being alledged for the delaying of Baptiſm; ſo many <hi>ſhifts</hi> uſed for the putting it off, in the <hi>Primitive Times;</hi> and yet the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of its being adminiſtred to Infants never once queſtioned all the while, the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lawfulneſs</hi> of it never urged; it is a plain caſe, that thoſe Times had no ſuch thoughts of Baptiſm as theſe have. For had they thought Infants baptiſm unlawful for want of a Scripture command for it, or example of it, when any had been exhorted to an early baptizing of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, how eaſie, and how unanſwerable an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer had been ready at hand? Chriſt never commanded any ſuch thing as Infants ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm; the Apoſtles never practiſed any ſuch thing as the baptizing of Infants; there is neither Precept for it, nor Example of it in Holy Scripture, and therefore it is unlawful, and we dare not do it. But in regard there is in all thoſe times not the leaſt appearance of any ſuch objection made againſt it, or of any ſuch plea pretended for the deferring of it, it is plain they thought there was either <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97369:19"/> for it, or <hi>example</hi> of it in Scripture, or both; or elſe thought that want of either, or both, did not make it unlawful, and ſo did not defer it upon account of the unlawfulneſs of it. And ſo all our <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> great boaſt of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> for the baptizing of only <hi>Adult</hi> believing Perſons, and againſt the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing of Believers Infant children, affords them but little roaſt, there is not the leaſt ſtrength added to their cauſe thereby, nor weakneſs brought upon ours. And I wiſh thoſe ignorant ones that are deluded with the great noiſe, and gay ſhow of it, to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice hereof, that they be no longer deceived thereby.</p>
            <p>And now this <hi>grand Prejudice</hi> being (as I hope it is) removed, I ſhall no longer detain the Reader from the Treatiſe it ſelf, than to deſire him to joyn with me in prayer to God, to bleſs it to the end for which it is deſigned.</p>

               <p>§. 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words were ſpoken by our Saviour to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. The occaſion of them was this. Certain Perſons came, and brought their Children alſo, to Jeſus, deſiring <hi>that he would touch them,</hi> (v. 15. ) that is, as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> relates it, <hi>put his h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:97369:21"/> 
                  <hi>and pray,</hi> (Matth. 19. 13. ) This action of theirs was ſo far diſliked of by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Diſciples, that they rebuked them, and would have chid them away. But this carriage of his Diſciples towards them our Saviour did very much diſlike of. Indeed St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>he was much diſpleaſed thereat, (Mark 10. 14.)</hi> And in that diſpleaſure, when he had called the Infants unto him, he ſpake unto his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples theſe words, <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. So that the words are an Oblique Rebuke given by our Saviour unto his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, for going about to hinder the coming of little Children unto him: and a direct command to permit their coming unto him for the future; and that Command backt with a direct Prohibition, forbidding their ever after hindring of them to come. <hi>And they brought unto him alſo Infants, that he ſhould touch them: but when his Diſciples ſaw it, they rebuked them. But Jeſus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them unto him, and ſaid, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of ſuch is the kingdom of God.</hi> From whence I gather this Point, <hi>That lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children are to be ſuffered to come unto Chriſt, and ought not to be forbidden coming unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:97369:21"/>
               <p>§. 3. This Doctrine is ſo near the very words of our Saviour, and thoſe recorded by three Evangeliſts, and that with ſo great concord, that in the Original, there is no difference among them, ſave in the order of the words, and in the variation of a Tenſe (St. <hi>Matthew</hi> uſing <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Aoriſt, whereas St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> uſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Preſent Tenſe, which difference in ſhew is really none indeed, the Aoriſt being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily uſed for the Preſent Tenſe) that it will not be much needful to prove it by any other <hi>medium,</hi> than what the Text it ſelf will afford; and that is this. What our Saviour commanded ſhould be permitted, and forbad ſhould be hindred, that ought to be ſuffered, and ought not to be forbidden. But our Saviour commanded that little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be permitted to come, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad they ſhould be hindred from coming to him. Therefore little Children are to be ſuffered, and ought not to be forbidden to come unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Yet for the opening of the Point three things I ſhall endeavour to clear: (1) What we are to underſtand by the <hi>Children</hi> that are to be ſuffered to come unto Chriſt. (2) Of <hi>what children</hi> it was that our Saviour gave command that they ſhould be ſuffered to come to him.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97369:22"/> (3) What coming of thoſe children unto Chriſt it is, that is to be ſuffered, and ought not to be hindred.</p>

               <p>§. 1. FOr the Second, Of what Children it was that our Saviour commanded, that they ſhould be ſuffer'd to come to him: it may be a queſtion, whether our Saviour did mean, what he ſaid, only of thoſe particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97369:23"/> then brought to him, but by his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples kept back from him; or whether his meaning in thoſe words were not of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite extent, ſo as that the concernment thereof may reach unto our children, as well as unto them. And to that my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that (at leaſt as I conceive) our Saviours words were not a Particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of concernment only to the then preſent Infants, but were of a concernment ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as to reach down even unto our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants alſo, at this diſtance from that time and place.</p>
               <p>§. 2. For firſt, Suppoſe the next day more Infants, or other Infants the ſame day, had been brought for the ſame end, that thoſe were, unto Chriſt, is it imaginable, that the Diſciples of our Saviour, would have again rebuked them that brought them, and ſo have ſtood in need of a new Rebuke from our Saviour for ſo dealing with them, and a new Command to ſuffer them to come to him? If this cannot with any reaſon be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, then it is moſt clear, that the words of our Saviour were of concernment unto <hi>more Infants,</hi> than thoſe particular Ones, at that time brought unto him. And if they concerned any more beſides them, then who can tell how many more beſides them they did concern? Yea what can with any colour
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97369:23"/> of reaſon be ſaid, why the concernment of them ſhould not be univerſal?</p>
               <p>§. 3. But ſecondly, There is nothing either in the <hi>Words</hi> of our Saviour, or in the <hi>Reaſon</hi> uſed by our Saviour, reſtraining the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment thereof unto thoſe Particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Firſt there is nothing in the Words of our Saviour. For they are Indefinite: and an Indefinite Enunciation it tantamount to an Univerſal. There is not an Individua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Particle in the whole Speech to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the concernment thereof to theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Infants. His Words only are, <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me.</hi> He doth not ſay, Suffer only <hi>theſe little</hi> children to come unto me. Take the words as they are in the Greek, and they only are <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>theſe little children.</hi> In St. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 14. the words are, <hi>Suffer the little children:</hi> but the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>the</hi> here is at moſt but an Emphatical note, intimating that the <hi>littleneſs</hi> of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be <hi>no hindrance</hi> to their coming to Chriſt: but that even the little, the leaſt of children, ſhould be permitted to come to him as well as elder bigger perſons: It is not an Individuating Pronoun ſingling out theſe from all others to be the onely children that ſhould be ſuffered to come to him. And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97369:24"/> in the Liturgie the words have no ſuch Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis upon them, being onely, Suffer little children to come unto me, juſt as here the ſame Greek words in the Text are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Secondly, there is nothing in the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> uſed by our Saviour reſtraining the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of his words to <hi>thoſe Particular Infants:</hi> his words being, not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>of theſe</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe,</hi> is an expreſſion very far from being reſtrictive exactly <hi>unto theſe.</hi> Nothing here then reſtraineth the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Saviours words unto thoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Infants: rather here is ſomething that enlargeth the concernment thereof to an Indefinite number of Infants. And that is the Conſideration of our Saviours fetching the Reaſon for the permiſſion of Childrens coming to him, not from ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was of particular concernment to <hi>theſe Children;</hi> but from ſuch an Head as was of general concernment unto all other Infants as well as theſe. He ſaith not, <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me,</hi> for they are children of my <hi>near kindred,</hi> ſpecial <hi>friends, favoureres,</hi> or <hi>benefactors,</hi> for whom I have a ſingular reſpect: but, <hi>Suffer little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to come unto me, for of ſuch is the kingdom of God;</hi> q. d. theſe and all Infants
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97369:24"/> of their age, are ſo qualified as they ought to be, who are to be the Subjects of my kingdom, into which there is no entrance for any, except they be converted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as little children, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 18. 3.) and therefore ſuffer them, and, by a parity of reaſon, all others too that ſhall be brought to me, no leſs than them, to come unto me.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Thirdly, there is ſomething in the Context, that clearly ſhews, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours words are more properly of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto <hi>other</hi> Infants, than to theſe. And that is the Point of Time, when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpake theſe words: and that was, after he had called the Infants unto him, and not before. For ſo it is evidently in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the verſe, <hi>But Jeſus</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>having called</hi> (i. e. when, or after that he had called) <hi>them (i. e.</hi> the <hi>Infants</hi> themſelves, and not his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> nor thoſe that brought the Infants) <hi>he ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. It is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in the neuter gender, which agrees with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Infants: not <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine gender, which it ſhould be if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred either to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Diſciples, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> thoſe that brought the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. And therefore <hi>Beza</hi> renders the Text, <hi>Jeſus verò quum puerulos advocaſſet, dixit,</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:97369:25"/> But Jeſus, when he had called the Infants, ſaid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now to make the concernment of our Saviours words to be proper to thoſe particular Infants, is to render our Saviours command perfectly needleſs. For what need were there of his bidding his Diſciples to ſuffer thoſe to come to him, that already were at, and with him. Yea ſuppoſe he had onely called them, and they were not yet come, who can imagine, that it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to give any further command to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to ſuffer thoſe to come at him, whom he had but juſt then called unto him? It is therefore of <hi>Infants in general,</hi> and not of thoſe particular Infants onely that he ſpake.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Yet Fourthly, Our Saviours ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe words upon that particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, doth not neceſſarily reſtrain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of his words unto thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Infants. Acts of juſtice, and acts of Grace, are of general concernment, though the occaſions of them be particular; unleſs there be ſomething in the circumſtances of the acts, that may lay a reſtraint upon their concernment. And the Apoſtle hath nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly taught us to draw general concluſions from particular expreſſions, (in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5, 6.) <hi>He hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor for ſake thee. So that we may boldly ſay,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:97369:25"/> 
                  <hi>The Lord is my helper.</hi> The promiſe of not being for ſaken of the Lord, was a particular one, made upon a particular occaſion, unto a particular perſon, namely <hi>Joſhua, (Joſ. 1. 5.)</hi> And yet ſaith the Apoſtle (ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is the concernment of it, that) <hi>we may boldly ſay, The Lord is my helper.</hi> And thus, were the occaſion of this Speech of our Saviour never ſo particular, yet how fairly is this general concluſion drawn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from? Chriſt gave order, that little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they were brought, ſhould be ſuffered to come to him, and not be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Therefore little children ſhould now, and at all times, be ſuffered, and ſhould not be forbidden to come unto Chriſt: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince, as there is the ſame <hi>need</hi> for our children, that there was for thoſe children, to come to Chriſt; ſo there is the ſame <hi>mercy</hi> in Chriſt now, to move him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our children, that there was in him then, to move him to receive theirs: and there is no circumſtance in all the action de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring our children of his mercy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining it unto theirs.</p>
               <p>§. 8. But it is time I ſhould proceed to ſpeak to the Third, and ſhew <hi>what coming</hi> of little children unto Chriſt it is, that is to be ſuffered, and ought not to be hindred.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>What coming of little children unto Chriſt is to be ſufferedm and ought not to be hindred.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. NOw to clear this, we muſt ſhew that the Phraſe of <hi>coming unto</hi> Chriſt is capable of various interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>§. 2. And firſt it notes an approach, or acceſs of any perſon unto Chriſt, as exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting himſelf corporally preſent in place. Thus thoſe Saducees came to him, that came to poſe him, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 22. 23.) And this is the ordinary and proper ſignification of the Phraſe. And in this ſenſe <hi>thoſe Infants</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the Text, <hi>did come</hi> to Chriſt. Their being <hi>brought</hi> to him, was <hi>a coming</hi> of theirs to him. When the Diſciples rebuked thoſe that <hi>brought them,</hi> our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that they [the children] ſhould be ſuffered <hi>to come</hi> unto him.</p>
               <p>§. 3. But in this ſenſe, now, our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren cannot come unto Chriſt. Chriſt is no where corporally preſent upon earth, that children may be carried to him, or in this ſenſe come at him. In Heaven indeed he is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97369:26"/> corporally preſent: but thither children cannot be carried, thither children cannot come. <hi>Whither I go ye cannot com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>(John 13. 23.) i. e.</hi> not till after death; nor then neither, but in ſpirit, till the reſurrection of the dead. <hi>For fleſh and blood</hi> (unchanged) <hi>cannot inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> (1 Cor. 15. 20.) So that the words taken in relation to children now, are not to be underſtood properly. And therefore unleſs we mean not to have our children come at Chriſt, we muſt go ſeek out ſome other meaning of the Phraſe, and find out ſome other way by which they may come to him.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Secondly, therefore the Phraſe may be taken Figuratively. And ſo ſometimes in notes a <hi>becoming, or a being made a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> unto Chriſt. And ſo, when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith (Matth. 11. 28.) <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour,</hi> his meaning is, become diſciples to me: for ſo it follows (in ver. 29.) <hi>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me.</hi> Where he offers himſelf to be a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to ſuch as ſhould come to him. And in what other ſenſe than this can we underſtand that (in John 3. 26.) <hi>Behold the ſame baptizeth, and all men</hi>

                  </note> ſo again (in <hi>John</hi> 6. 37, 44, 65.) In all which places the phraſe of coming unto Chriſt, implies a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming diſciples to him, being made his Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes.</p>
               <p>§. 5. So then, to become a Diſciple to Chriſt is in one ſenſe to come to Chriſt. And if children may be made Diſciples to Chriſt, then there is a way left, whereby they alſo, as well as elder perſons, may come to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§. 6. And that they may, is very fairly hinted even in this Text: the words which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97369:27"/> our Saviour uſeth to expreſs the coming of theſe Infants to him by, being the very words, as is obſerved, <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi>

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:97369:28"/>
               <p>§. 7. And it is fully confirmed by the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which our Saviour gives for this his <hi>Command</hi> of ſuffering the little children to come unto him, and <hi>Prohibition</hi> of any mans hindring them from coming, in the latter end of the verſe, <hi>for of ſuch is the kingdom of God.</hi> Which what other ſenſe can it have than this, Little children have in them ſuch qualifications; as ought to be in every one, that belongs to my kingdom, that is, in every Diſciple of mine, every Proſelyte unto Chriſtianity: and therefore let even them alſo, as well as others, come to me, be made my Diſciples, admitted as Proſelytes unto, and received as Subjects into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God: it being moſt reaſonable that they ſhould be received into the kingdom of God, who are ſuch as the kingdom of God conſiſteth of. So then Children may become Diſciples of Chriſt, be made his Proſelytes. And if Childrens <hi>being brought</hi> to Chriſt was lookt upon by him as <hi>their coming</hi> to him; why ſhould we not think that their being brought to him to be his Diſciples will be lookt upon by him as their coming to him to be his Diſciples? Since him that cometh to him he will in no wiſe caſt out, <hi>(John</hi> 6. 37.)</p>
               <p>§. 8. O but, the doubt ſtill remains, which way may our children become, or be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97369:28"/> made Diſciples to Chriſt. I anſwer by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized in the Name, and with the Baptiſm of Chriſt. As Baptiſm was one Ceremony by which before Chriſts time Heathens were made Diſciples unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo Baptiſm was the onely Ceremony by which, both in and after Chriſts time, both Heathens and Jews were made Diſciples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt. And this is evident as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part from what was cuſtomary among the Jews: (as we ſhall ſee afterwards) whence that Baptiſm, by which men were admitted Members of the Church of the Jews was called <hi>Baptiſmus ad Proſelytiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> The Baptiſm of men for Proſelytiſm, or bringing them into Diſcipleſhip: ſo in the latter part from what is ſaid by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf (in Matth. 28. 19.) <hi>Go ye therefore, and</hi>

And accordingly the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Interpreters explain <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi> to be <hi>making Chriſtians.</hi>

And there is no neceſſity from our Saviours words, that there muſt be both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one can be a Diſciple in any meaſure or degree. For our Saviour doth not ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly make diſciples <hi>baptizing and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> but without any conjunction, <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them, teaching them.</hi> So that where either of theſe is, there a Perſon may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, or be made a Diſciple, though not ſo compleat and perfect, as where there is both.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. NOw interpret the words any other way, and I cannot imagine how the Reaſon, which our Saviour gives, why Children ſhould be ſuffered to come to him, <hi>(viz.</hi> becauſe they are ſuch as the kingdom of God conſiſteth of) ſhould not be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, either to his Command to ſuffer them to come, or elſe to the Occaſion of his giving of that Command.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Firſt, interpret the words of coming to him by way of <hi>bodily approach</hi> whileſt he was corporally preſent <hi>upon earth:</hi> and ſo indeed thoſe Infants might and did come to him. But how was their being <hi>ſuch as the kingdom of God conſiſted of,</hi> a Reaſon of their being ſuffered ſo to come? For if there were any force in that Reaſon, then by the ſame Reaſon, none but ſuch as the Kingdom of God conſiſted of ſhould have been ſuffered to come to Chriſt. Which as it is contrary to Practice; for there were ſuffered to come to Chriſt ſuch as the kingdom of God ought not to conſiſt of, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as ſought the death
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97369:30"/> and deſtruction of Chriſt: ſo likewiſe it is contrary to Reaſon; for how ſhould Chriſt by his preaching have converted ſuch as were not of his kingdom, conſidered according to their preſent ſtate, if they might not have been ſuffered to come to him, but muſt have been forbidden coming? So that of a mere <hi>bodily acceſs</hi> unto Chriſts corporal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence the words are not interpretable: ſuch an interpretation croſſing our Saviours Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he gives for theſe words.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Again, interpret the words of coming to him where he is now <hi>corporally</hi> preſent <hi>in heaven:</hi> and ſo, ſuppoſing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may come to him, and ſuppoſing them ſuch in ſome reſpect, as that Kingdom of God conſiſteth of, ſo the Reaſon will have ſome pertinency to the Command of our Saviour to ſuffer them to come; ſuch not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be denied reception into that kingdom of God, as that Kingdom of God conſiſteth of. But then how will our Saviours Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand be pertinent to the preſent Occaſion of his ſpeech? No queſtion being made by his Diſciples at that time about the final eſtates of children dying in their Infancy; and the whole matter being that they denied admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome Infants brought by others unto Chriſt to be touched by the Impoſition of his hands, and to be prayed over by him,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97369:31"/> probably in order to their being made his Proſelytes by baptiſm: at which denial of theirs he being angry, gave order that the children ſhould be ſuffered to come to him, namely for ſuch purpoſe as thoſe then came, in all likelihood to be by his Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands and Prayer conſigned over unto Proſelytiſm, and ſhould not be hindred from coming to him.</p>
               <p>§. 4. And what were a declaration of childrens capacity for glory, and fitneſs to come to Chriſt, when he ſhould be corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally preſent in Heaven, if they died in their infancy, to this matter? eſpecially at a time when Chriſt was not corporally preſent in Heaven, but lived in body here below upon the earth.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Again a Command ſo given, as this was, would ſuppoſe an ability in thoſe, to whom it was given, to do contrary unto that Command, namely, to hinder Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from reception into the Kingdom of God, notwithſtanding their greateſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city for that kingdom. But that was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then in the power of his Diſciples, nor now is in the power of any man on earth. Suppoſing children dying in their Infancy to belong to the kingdom of glory, it is needleſs to command any man to ſuffer them to come to that kingdom.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:97369:31"/>
               <p>§. 6. So that neither of a Spiritual acceſs of theſe children unto Chriſt, where he is now corporally preſent in glory are theſe words interpretable: ſuch an interpretation of our Saviours words rendring them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to the occaſion of them. And I hope none will ſay that our Saviour did at any time ſpeak impertinent words.</p>
               <p>§. 7. And therefore not being able to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine any other way by which our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may come, and yet may be hindred from coming unto Chriſt, but that One way, which hath hitherto been inſiſted on, namely by being made Diſciples to Chriſt, by being baptized into the Name and Faith of Chriſt. I conclude that this way our children ought to be ſuffered to come to Chriſt, and ought not to be hindred from ſo coming.</p>
               <p>§. 8. And now, the Point being thus explained, and the Explication thereof thus vindicated, I appeal to Common Reaſon, whether or no there be not here that, which the Antipaedobaptiſts of theſe days do with ſo much inſolency demand of us, <hi>viz.</hi> a fair and clear Scripture Ground for Infants Baptiſm. If Children may come to Chriſt, and muſt by the command of Chriſt be ſuffered to come to him, and there be no other way of their coming to him but by Baptiſm: what can be more plain, than that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97369:32"/> in commanding that they ſhould be ſuffered to come to him, he commanded that they ſhould be ſuffered to be baptized, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad that they ſhould be hindred from Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
               <p>§. 9. And by this time I hope it appears with how good judgment our Church hath appointed this paſſage of Scripture, (which, as <hi>H. D.</hi> tells us, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (of old) the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <note place="margin">

               <p>§. 10. Yet leaſt any man ſhould think this Collection alone to be too weak a ground to bear that weight we lay upon it, (though by the way I muſt ſay, that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence from Scripture rightly made is a ground good enough to bear any weight that can be fairly laid upon it, and as valid to all intents and purpoſes as if it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Scripture it ſelf, that being eminently contained in the Scripture, what ever it be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97369:32"/> that may be fairly drawn from it: and that we have no better ground then a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from Scripture to build other Points of our Chriſtian Faith upon, every way as weighty and material as Infants Baptiſm is,) yet, I ſay, I ſhall for your better ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the belief of this Catholick truth, confirm it unto you by this one further Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>§. 11. That by which Children may have Benefit; for which they have Need; of which they are Capable; and to which they have Right, that they ought to be ſuffered to have, and ought not to be denied the having of. But Children may have Benefit by Baptiſm; they have Need for Baptiſm; they are Capable of Baptiſm; and they have a Right unto Baptiſm. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to be ſuffered to have it, and they ought not to be denied the having of it.</p>
               <p>§. 12. That Children ought to be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have, and ought not to be denied that, whereby they may be Benefited; for which they have Need; of which they are Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; and to which they have a Right, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it not needful to prove.

               </p>
               <p>§. 5. Now for children, even in their Infancy to become by the deſignation of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97369:34"/> their Parents Gods own portion, and to be made Holy unto the Lord, this certainly cannot but be for the childrens good. For as much as being appropriated unto God in a nearer relation, they will be reſpected by him with a dearer affection.</p>
               <p>§. 6. When any Thing is offered unto God in ſincerity, God kindly accepts of it. You may ſee inſtances in <hi>Abels</hi> offering the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings <note place="margin">

               <p>§. 7. So that for our children to be by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97369:35"/> us offered, and conſecrated unto God and his ſervice is the way to intitle them to Gods favour, and to derive on them his bleſſing. And that's reaſon enough, were there no more, why we ſhould baptize them, and by ſo doing intitle God more nearly to them, entring them into the Catalogue of his more peculiar poſſeſſions, liſting them as <hi>Tyros</hi> into the number of his ſouldiers, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolling them into his family as his more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſervants. Whereupon our Church in her Office for the Baptizing of Infants, not onely gives the baptized Infant a Croſs in his forehead, as a badge and cognizance of his Profeſſion, and Relation; but alſo prays to God for him, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him for his own child by Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Not to add, that ſo early a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of them unto God, and to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſo timely a Dedication of them unto piety and holineſs, is not without a great probability of being very influential on them in their future lives, in the way of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative of them from impierty and iniquity: natural conſcience, that light ſet up in the ſoul by the Author of Lights, being likely to ſuggeſt unto them, in their firſt approaches to underſtanding and reaſon, what a ſhame it will be for them to give themſelves unto

And this profeſſion and abrenun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, Infants, becauſe they cannot make it in their own Perſons, are by the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to make by others in their names.

               <p>§. 4.

               <p>§. 7. And though the Baptized Infant be under no Scriptural injunction in the caſe, yet there are many weighty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, whereby he is obliged, as ſoon as he comes to underſtanding, to take upon himſelf, ſtand to, and make good in his own perſon that Promiſe and Vow made

               <p>§. 8. As firſt, that he do not diſparage the Church his Spiritual Mothers Wiſdom, who has contrived this way for bringing him within the number of its Members; and making him a partaker of its Priviledges.</p>

And again, that <hi>This grace doth ingraft and put in even the little ones that are baptized into his body.</hi> So <hi>Aquinas, Children, as well as Adult perſons, are made mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt in Baptiſm.</hi> And <hi>for this cauſe,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Chryſoſtom, do we ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize Infants, that they may be members of him,</hi> that is, <hi>of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. And the reaſon is the ſame for the one and for the other. Becauſe it is not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Baptiſms, but one and the ſame Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, that is adminiſtred unto the one, and unto the other. For there is but one Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm for all. One, as well as the other, Men and Children, all that are baptized, are <hi>baptized into Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Now this being ſo, what can be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97369:49"/> more viſible, than that Baptiſm is hugely beneficial to Infants. For being by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm made Members of Chriſt they have union with him, as the Members have with the Head: and by that Union much benefit is derived to them.</p>
               <p>§. 6. For firſt there is great honour comes to them thereby. The Members partake of the honour of the Head. To be the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſuch a Head, as is <hi>Head over all things</hi> (Epheſ. 1. 22. ) <hi>the Head of all principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and power</hi> (Coloſſ. 2. 10. ) what an honour muſt this needs be to them? <hi>Like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard, even</hi> Aarons <hi>beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments,</hi> ſo the honourableneſs of Chriſt the Head hath a deſcending influence on his in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erior members, ſo as to render them alſo in ſome meaſure and degree honourable.</p>
               <p>By vertue of the Union of Chriſts natural body with God, there is a great honour comes to that his body: ſo by vertue of the Union of the myſtical body of Chriſt with Chriſt its Head, there is a great deal of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour coming alſo to that body of his. His natural body is not the mere body of a man, but the body of God; ſo his myſtical body is not a mere humane body, but <hi>the body of Chriſt.</hi> (2 Cor. 12. 27.) As it is with an
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97369:49"/> imp or ſcion that is taken off from any ſtock of a meaner kind, and ingraſſed, or inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into a nobler ſtock, and partakes with the ſtock into which it is ingraſſed of its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable appellation: ſo it is with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; though <hi>by nature they be wild olive trees,</hi> yet being by Baptiſm ingrafted into Chriſt the good olive tree, made members of his body, they do partake with Chriſt in ſome degree of that honour which is given unto him. They have <hi>his name called upon them</hi> by others (Acts 11. 26.) <hi>He</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>is not aſhamed to call them brethren,</hi> (Heb. 2. 2. 11. ) Not the leaſt Infant Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but is a Brother, a Branch, a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt: and ſo is honourable in its Relation to him, and hath an honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due unto it upon account of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that it hath with him.</p>
               <p>§. 7. But ſecondly they do not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive honour by Chriſt, but alſo influence from Chriſt, by vertue of their Union with him. The Head hath an influence upon the whole body, and every member of it. Senſe and motion is by the animal ſpirits commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the whole body and every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it from the head: ſo hath Chriſt an influence upon his whole body and every the leaſt member of it. From him by his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual grace is communicated to his body, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97369:50"/> every the leaſt member of it, ſuitable to the manner and meaſure of its recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, a principle of ſenſe of God and Goodneſs, and of motion to attain the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the one by the practice of the other: which, though for a while it give forth no indications of its preſence in them, yet will in due time exert its proper efficacy; and in the mean time it lies at the heart, like the ſap at the root, prediſpoſing it unto a future fructification. <hi>Of his fullneſs</hi> (ſaith St. John) <hi>we have all received, and grace for grace,</hi> (John 1. 16. ) There is a fullneſs of grace in Chriſt for, and an influence of grace from Chriſt to, all that are in him. <hi>Of his fullneſs we all receive.</hi> By partaking of the root we participate of the fatneſs of the olive tree, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 11. 17. ) There goes vertue from him to all that are his. Not the leaſt member of him but has an influence of grace from him. There is from him an emanation of quickening effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to the ſmalleſt Infant member in him: being united to him, it partakes with him according to its condition and capacity; and that ſeminal grace communicated by him to the Infant at the inſtant of its beginning to be one in and with him, will in time bring forth its fruit; unleſs ſtifled, ere it bud, by the luxuriant rankneſs of vitious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97369:50"/> too thickly growing in a depraved nature, and too early ripened by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting education.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Thirdly, they are intereſſed in the care of Chriſt for them. The head cares for all the body, and for every member of it: ſo doth Chriſt the head of his Church, take care for his whole Church, and for every the leaſt perſon of it. And if ye ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, the firſt inſtance of Chriſts care for his Church in his charge to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> was for his <hi>Lambs,</hi> his little members, that could leaſt care for themſelves; and then follows his care for his ſheep. He firſt ſaith, <hi>Feed my lambs:</hi> and then after, <hi>Feed my ſheep,</hi> John 21. 15, 16, 17. After whoſe example St. <hi>John</hi> his boſome diſciple begins his Epiſtle with <hi>little children;</hi> and then goes on to <hi>fathers</hi> and young men, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>§. 9. And ſure 'tis worth ſomething, and that no ſmall matter neither, to have ſuch a one as Chriſt taking care for our Infants; and taking ſuch a care for them, as a head takes care for the members of that body that is united to it. Oh how they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in his eye, and in his heart! what tender regard he has to them! what melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affections for them! How kind he was to little children, and how careful of them
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97369:51"/> whilſt on earth is ſet forth with an illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſplendour, here in the Text, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. <hi>He called them to him, he commanded acceſs for them, he rebuked thoſe,</hi> (though the darlings of his affections his diſciples) <hi>that would have kept them from him;</hi> and becauſe he had them much in his heart, he <hi>took them</hi> near to it, <hi>in his arms;</hi> he gave them the <hi>Impoſition of his hands,</hi> and the <hi>Benediction of his mouth,</hi> would have both hand, tongue and all, concern'd, and be active too, in the promoting of their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual intereſt. And can we think, he, that had ſo much kindneſs for them on earth, hath no care for them now in heaven? Did he throw off all reſpect to them, when he removed hence from them? Did he loſe the affectionateneſs of his humanity by the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of it? Is he leſs good, for being more great? If nothing of this, not the leaſt apex of it may be imagined, we may then be ſecure of his care for our children. And if to be under the care of ſo diſcerning an eye, ſo wiſe a head, ſo ſtrong a hand, ſo tender a heart, as Jeſus Chriſt is, be a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, as moſt undoubtedly it is, and that a great one, conſidering the infinite advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages conſequent thereunto for protection, preſervation, proviſion, improvement of natural faculties, endowment with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97369:51"/> abilities, initiation in grace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation in glory, then the beneficialneſs of Baptiſm to Infants, who are thereby brought under all this care, is beyond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute: and there is reaſon enough in that, if there were nothing elſe to move us to it, to baptize our Infants. If we would have Chriſt to have this care for them, it ſhould then be our care to baptize them.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Fourthly, they are intereſted in the care of the Church for them. They that are united to the Head, are united to the Body. They that are united to Chriſt, are united alſo to the Church. Communion with the Church follows Union with Chriſt. And as it were to intimate this, we are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaid to be baptized into the head, and ſometimes into the body; ſometimes into Chriſt, and ſometimes into the Church: for as much as all comes to one; becauſe Chriſt and his Church, the Head and the Body are all one; and he that is united to, and hath communion with either, is united to, and hath communion with the other.</p>
               <p>§. 11. Hence our Church in her office of Baptiſm declares the baptized Infant to be <hi>grafted into the body of Chriſts Church;</hi> and gives thanks to God for <hi>incorporating him into his holy Church;</hi> as ſhe had prayed before that he might <hi>be received into the Ark of Chriſts Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:97369:52"/>
               <p>§. 12. And as the Head takes care for all the members; ſo the <hi>members alſo take care one for another,</hi> (1 Cor. 12. 25.) they <hi>rejoyce,</hi> and <hi>ſuffer</hi> one with another, and have the <hi>ſame ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§. 13. Now as to the caſe in hand, great truly is the care of our Church for her little members, her baptized Infants. She cares for their maintenance, cares for their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, cares for their education, cares for their inſtruction, that <hi>they may be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly brought up to lead a godly and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life;</hi> in order whereunto ſhe not only gives both ſo grave an admonition to the Sureties for children at their baptizing, <hi>to remember that it is their parts and duties to ſee that the Infants be taught, ſo ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§. 14. Now if to have not only the Natural <hi>Parents</hi> of a child, but <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers</hi> alſo, who are a kind of ſpiritual Parents, Fathers and Mothers in God, to it; nor them only, but the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> alſo of the Pariſh; nor him only, but the whole <hi>Pariſh</hi> alſo; nor that only, but the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>

               <p>§. 15. Yet fifthly, by vertue of this Union of Infants with Chriſt and his Church
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97369:53"/> his Body by their being baptized thereinto, they are intereſted in all the <hi>Interceſſions of Chriſt</hi> for his Church, and in all the <hi>Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Church</hi> unto God. Whether Chriſt pray to his Father for his Church, or the Church pray to God for her ſelf, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants that cannot pray for themſelves, are prayed for thereby. Chriſt excludes not baptized Infants from the benefit of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions: for he intercedes for his Body, and they are members of it.

                  </note> with Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> and others, I do believe, that the mere want of baptiſm, where it cannot be had, is not abſolutely excluſive of all unbaptized ones out of heaven, but only the contempt of it, where it may be had; yet two things may be obſerved from that Text (of <hi>John</hi> 3. 5.) which carry it high for a neceſſity of Infants baptiſm, at leaſt ſo far as to be an excuſe for thoſe, who gathered therefrom an abſolute neceſſity of it.</p>
               <p>§. 8. The firſt is this, That the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God here, in the notion of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, not only Gods <hi>ſpiritual kingdom on earth,</hi> or the viſible Church (which is all that the Anabaptiſts will have it to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; and upon this deſign, becauſe they would by this diſtinction avoid the force of the Argument hence for Infants Baptiſm, for whoſe ſalvation they conclude it not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that they be made members of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, as having devoted them all, without exception of any, to be eternally ſaved, if dying in infancy, though dying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized) but it doth alſo in the notion of it include Gods <hi>eternal kingdom in heaven.</hi> Becauſe the kingdom here that a man <hi>cannot</hi>

                  <hi>enter into</hi> except he be born of water and of the ſpirit, is the ſame kingdom that (in <hi>ver.</hi> 3.) a man <hi>cannot ſee</hi> except he be born again. Now it is not true of Gods kingdom on earth, that a man cannot ſee it, except he be born again of water and of the ſpirit, that is, baptized: for it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the viſible Church, becauſe it is a Church that may be ſeen, And ſeen it may be of ſuch as deſire to come to it, &amp; joyn with it, before they be of it: for how elſe ſhall they deſire to come to it? Seen alſo it is, and may be, of ſuch as are of it; and even of thoſe that do oppoſe, &amp; fight againſt it. But of the kingdom of God in heaven it is moſt true, that except a man be born of water and of the ſpirit he cannot ſee that. Therefore that kingdom which a man cannot enter into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be born of water, and of the ſpirit doth in the notion of it include the kingdom of God in Heaven.</p>
               <p>§. 9. And if the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> here (in <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. 5.) be the ſame with that which is called (in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14.) the <hi>kingdom of heaven;</hi> which again St. <hi>Luke</hi> (in my Text) renders by that very ſame expreſſion in St. <hi>John, the kingdom of God,</hi> then we ſhall find the Anabaptiſts, when it is for their turn, interpreting it of <hi>Gods kingdom in heaven.</hi> For that very Text do
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97369:63"/> they alledge to prove that <note place="margin">Confeſſ. of Faith, Art. 10.</note> not any Infant dying in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy before the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of actual ſin, ſhall ſuffer eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in hell for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin: for of ſuch (as they pleaſe to ſpeak) belongs the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. And if it muſt be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted there (in <hi>John</hi> 3. 5.) of the viſible Church, then it muſt be here alſo, in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 16. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. And ſo then children will be ſuch as belong to the Church Catholick, as members of it, of whom it is: and then why ſhould they not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into it, <hi>that</hi> belong unto it?</p>
               <p>§. 10. And if any thing be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this, becauſe it is not ſaid, <hi>of theſe,</hi> but <hi>of ſuch as theſe,</hi> is the kingdom of God; the ſame will be objected againſt their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the kingdom of glory, which they intitle them to, (from <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not there ſaid, of <hi>theſe,</hi> but <hi>of ſuch as theſe</hi> is the kingdom of heaven.

Heaven then being the region of light, the paradiſe of pleaſure, the habitation of joy, the manſion of peace, the ſeat of bliſs, the reſt of the Saints, the country of Angels, the court of God, a kingdom of glory, an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, where our ſolaces ſhall be pure, our happineſs compleat, and our life eternal: and Baptiſm being ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conducible, if not abſolutely neceſſary,

               <p>§. 5. Now for the firſt of theſe, the Grace of Juſtification, that that is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated in Baptiſm, is evident from the ſpeech of <hi>Ananias</hi> unto <hi>Paul</hi> (Acts 22. 16.) bidding him, ariſe <hi>and be baptized, and waſh away his ſins,</hi> calling on the name of the Lord.

Then for the ſecond the Grace of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, that that alſo is communicated in Baptiſm is evident from that of the Apoſtle (in Tit. 3. 4, 5.) <hi>After the kindneſs of God our Saviour towards man appeared, not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done,</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:97369:66"/> 
                  <hi>but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> i. e. by the Grace of Sanctification, which is a work of the Holy Ghoſt, uſually begun in Baptiſm, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly wrought by it, in ſome meaſure in the party baptized, at leaſt ſo far as amounts to the putting into him the firſt principle of it, whereby he is in time, and by degrees brought to a newneſs of condition, actually regenerated into a new creature.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Hence <hi>Peter</hi> unto the convert Jews <hi>(Acts</hi> 2.) promiſes upon their Baptiſm the gift of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>(v. 38.) Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> For <hi>the promiſe is made to you, and to your children,</hi> &amp;c. The promiſe. What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? Why, the Promiſe of <hi>the gift of</hi> (that implies ſure, if any thing more, yet howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>ſanctification</hi> by) <hi>the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> By what means? why, by Baptiſm: for 'tis expreſly ſaid, <hi>Be baptized, and ye ſhall receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 8. In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. we have both theſe Graces together ſet down as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of Baptiſmal waſhing. <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed</hi> (the means in Baptiſm that laver of regeneration)
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97369:67"/> 
                  <hi>but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the name of of Lord Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>by the ſpirit of our God.</hi> As if he had ſaid, ye are now new creatures, other men than formerly ye were: for ye have been baptized, and in your baptiſm have had conferred upon you both the Grace of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, by the Name of the Lord Jeſus; and the Grace of Sanctification, by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our God.</p>
               <p>§. 9. And perhaps the ſame is intimated in that of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians. Husbands love your wives, even as Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctific and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word, that he might preſent it unto himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh,</hi> (Epheſ. 5. 25, 26, 27.) Here cleanſing may note Juſtification: that Grace being expreſſed by that very word (1 John 1. 7.) where the <hi>blood of Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to cleanſe,</hi> that is to juſtifie <hi>us from all ſin.</hi> And then the Church of Chriſt, which conſiſts of Perſons of all ſorts and ages, ſmall and great, old and young that have been baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, will have both Juſtification and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion communicated and conveyed to it by the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97369:67"/> 
                  <hi>waſhing of water with the word,</hi> that is by Baptiſm, the water whereof is ſanctified to that uſe by the word of God. And that will make it a glorious Church indeed, to be both juſtified, not having ſpot or wrinkle upon it or any ſuch thing; and to be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, being holy and without blemiſh.</p>
               <p>§. 10. And this ſenſe of the thing our preſent Church hath: whilſt in her office of Publick Baptiſm ſhe prays for the Infant to be baptized, that he may <hi>receive remiſſion of his ſins, and be ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and in her Catechiſm ſhe teaches the Baptized <hi>Catechumen,</hi> that <hi>hereby,</hi> that is, by Baptiſm, <hi>we are made children of grace,</hi> that is gracious children, acceptable to, and accepted of by God; accepted by the grace of Juſtification, and made acceptable by the grace of Sanctification.</p>
               <p>§. 11. And this ſenſe of it the Primitive Church of Chriſt alſo had. Firſt, as to the Grace of Juſtification. Hence the <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> in their Creed <note n="a" place="margin">

Salvation is ſuch a thing, that whatſoever doth effect that, or is but in any meaſure conducible to the effecting of that, muſt needs be acknowledged beneficial to them that are ſaved. Beſides God the great Saviour of all men, there are ſeveral things to which a ſaving efficacy is aſcribed: as Faith, the Word of Faith, the Miniſters of the Word, Prayer, and amongſt the reſt Baptiſm. Whence are we Chriſtians? 'Tis a queſtion that St. <hi>Baſil</hi> asks. To which, ſaith he, <note place="margin">

Why, by being regenerated through the grace conferred in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm; or (as his words are well enough capable of being rendred) through grace by Baptiſm.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:97369:74"/>
               <p>§. 3. Now this ſalvifick efficacy of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm not for men, but infants alſo, might eaſily be inferred from the foregoing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: in as much as ſalvation conſiſts but in the obtaining, and enjoying that mercy, Grace, and Glory, which Baptiſm qualifies them for, conſigns, and intitles them to; and which they, upon due perſeverance in the grace thereof, ſhall be made partakers of.</p>
               <p>§. 4. But there is a nearer way to be taken than ſuch a repetition of particulars. Our Church ſaith, <hi>It is certain by Gods word, that Children which are baptized, dying before they commit actual ſin are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſaved.</hi> Children dying before the commiſſion of actual ſin are capable of no other means of ſalvation but Baptiſm, and, that which is joyned with it, Prayer. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Baptiſm with the Prayer of Faith they are ſaved.</p>
               <p>§. 5. But is this certain by the word of God? Yes ſurely, by good argument drawn from it. For baptiſin being the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the blood of Chriſt to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty baptized for the taking away of that ſin whereof he ſtands charged; and Infants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chargeable with no ſin <hi>but that ſin of the world,</hi> which is taken away by the blood of the lamb of God applied to them in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97369:75"/> it muſt follow, that being freed from that, they muſt be ſaved.</p>
               <p>§. 6. But we will go to Scripture-Text it ſelf for proof. Our Saviour hath ſaid, (Mark. 16. 16.) <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Here we have ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation promiſed upon two performances; the one by us, the other upon us: that by us is Faith; that upon us is Baptiſm. Now as he that hath both theſe, is certainly ſaved: ſo no doubt at all of his ſalvation, that hath but either of theſe, ſo it be not his fault that he hath not the other. And if our bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Infants have not the one, which is Faith, yet they have the other, which is Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Put caſe one believe, and be in no poſſibility of being baptized, who doubts now of his ſalvation? even juſt ſo, in caſe one be baptized, and be in no capacity to believe, there cannot reaſonably be any doubt made of his being ſaved.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Our Saviour wrought many ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations for their bodies, who by themſelves had made no application to him in a way of prayer or faith, upon the faith and prayer of others. And what doubt but he is as ready to work ſalvation for the ſouls of our Infants, though in no capacity of applying themſelves to him by prayer or faith, even
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97369:75"/> upon the faith and prayer of thoſe that bring them to baptiſm? Had Chriſt mercy only for bodies? Or hath he not it much more for ſouls? Or hath he mercy only for the ſouls of men? and not alſo for the ſouls of Infants? And who ever reſtrained the efficacy of Faith and Prayer in the uſe of Means to bodily ſalvation, that it cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail alſo for the ſaving of ſouls? theirs eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially who as they can do nothing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to advance it, ſo they do nothing of themſelves to hinder it. All poſſible proper means then being uſed for their ſalvation, which is their baptizing with the prayer of faith, there is no reaſon to doubt of their being ſaved. And therefore our Church having, after the recital of the Goſpel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed on that occaſion, which contains this order of Chriſts to ſuffer the little Children to come <note place="margin">Doubt yo not therefore, but ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly believe, that he will likewiſe favourably receive this preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, that he will embrace him with the arms of his mercy, that he will give unto him the bleſſing of eternal life, and make him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his everlaſting kingdom, <hi>Pub. Bap. of Infants.</hi>
                  </note> unto him, deſcanted a while on the good will of our Saviour to thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, proceeds from thence to exhort the bringers of the Infant unto Baptiſm, <hi>not to doubt</hi> of the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:97369:76"/>
               <p>§. 9. But further, as our Saviour ſaid, <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized ſhall be ſaved,</hi> ſo one of our Saviours Apoſtles ſaid of him, that <hi>according to his mercy he ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (Tit. 3. 5.) that is by Chriſtian Baptiſm, which conſiſts of thoſe two parts, the waſhing of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt. The words are a <hi>Meriſmus,</hi> a Rhetorical Figure of Speech, wherein inſtead of any <hi>Totum</hi> or whole thing, is ſet an enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its parts. As when for the <hi>world,</hi> which God in the beginning did create, it is ſaid, <hi>In the beginning God created the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the earth,</hi> Gen. 1. 1. As the <hi>heaven</hi> and the <hi>earth,</hi> the two conſtituent integral <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> are put for the <hi>world</hi> there: ſo here <hi>the waſhing of regeneration,</hi> and <hi>the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> the two conſtituent integral <hi>parts</hi> of Chriſtian <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,</hi> are put for <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> Juſt as when our Saviour (John 3. 5.) ſaid to <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Except a man be born of water and of the ſpirit he cannot enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> by naming the two conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent integral parts of Baptiſm <hi>water</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> he meant Chriſtian <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which conſiſts of thoſe two parts, without which in the ordinary way of ſalvation, as far as
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97369:76"/> that is revealed unto us, and without tying God in extraordinary caſes unto ordinary means, there is no entrance into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</p>
               <p>§. 10. And another of his Apoſtles doth poſitively and expreſly ſay that <hi>Baptiſm doth now ſave us,</hi> (1 Pet. 3. 21.) Not that it hath any Phyſical vertue in it ſelf in the way of a Natural Cauſe to effect our Salvation, but that it hath a ſaving efficacy for ſuch end communicated unto it by God the Ordainer of it, who works the effect of it by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation of his Spirit with it, and that it doth exert its efficacy, and hath that effect, upon all ſuch, as do not fruſtrate the grace of God beſtowed on them, and wrought in them, in, and by it: which certainly our Children before the Commiſſion of wilfull actual ſin do not do. And what is ſaid more than ſo, of Faith, or the Word, or Prayer, or any other Grace or Means, which we call ſaving?</p>
               <p>§. 11. Nor let any here tell me, that the Apoſtle doth expreſly deny this efficacy to that part of Baptiſm, which is the only part which Infants are capable of, namely <hi>the putting away the filth of the fleſh,</hi> or the external waſhing with water.</p>
               <p>§. 12. For firſt, (not in the leaſt to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the external waſhing to be the only part
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97369:77"/> of Baptiſm, which Infants are capable of; for who can tell in what manner the Holy Spirit can, or in what meaſures he doth inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate himſelf, and communicate his grace, and exert his efficacies in very Infants? or who can deny any thing of all this to them!) the Apoſtle was a Jew; and wrote this Epiſtle to the Jews; and his meaning plainly is this, to deny (if he do deny any thing) the ſaving effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of that Baptiſm he ſpeaks of, to any legal Jewiſh <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>§. 13. Secondly however, if what he ſaith were to be underſtood of the external waſhing with water in Baptiſm, yet his meaning is not to deny that ſaving efficacy he ſpeaks of to that, but not to appropriate it unto that only; but to communicate it with that, whatever it be that he calls <gap reason="foreign">

So when he ſaid, <hi>He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that ſent me,</hi> John 12. 44. his meaning was not to deny that he that believed on him, did not believe on him: but to affirm, that he that did believe on him, did not believe on him only, but alſo on him that ſent him. So the Apoſtles meaning here is not to deny, that <hi>the putting away the filth of the fleſh doth ſave us (viz.</hi> in its order, degree, and meaſure) but that not that only, or alone doth ſave us; but that, together with <hi>the Anſwer of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards God</hi> made by, or for the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized.</p>
               <p>§. 14. And now after all this, what need I, or what can I add more, that may ſet
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97369:78"/> forth the Beneficialneſs of Baptiſm to thoſe that are Baptized, whether Infants or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. What greater benefit than Salvation? What more beneficial than that that ſaves? If then to baptize our children be a means to ſave our children (and indeed that with our faith and prayer be all the means we can uſe in order to their ſaving) how ſhould not the conſideration hereof, if we deſire (as how can we but deſire?) they ſhould be ſaved, move us to baptize them? Yea, how ſhall we free our ſelves from the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of great uncharitableneſs, that I ſay not injuſtice, towards the offspring of our own bowels, if we may have, and do deſpiſe, or neglect the procuring for them this ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial a means of their ſalvation?</p>
               <p>And thus I have diſpatcht the firſt Branch of my Argument: and have ſhewn you, that Infants may have Benefit by Baptiſm, and what is the Benefit that they may have by it.</p>

               <p>§. 1. I Now go on to the Second, the <hi>Need</hi> which Children have for Baptiſm. And in the ſhewing of that I will begin with that, which Children have with them at their beginning, and is derived to them from their beginning, and that is, as it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually called, <hi>Original Sin.</hi> And if it do appear, that Children are born infected with that Epidemical Malady of Original Sin; and that Baptiſm is a Means (the only ordinary Inſtrumental Means) by which they may be healed of that Malady, then certainly it will not by any reaſonable man be denied, that Infants do ſtand in need of Baptiſm: unleſs haply it can be ſuppoſed, what yet is utterly unſuppoſeable, that one that is ſick of a diſeaſe, whereof he will die without cure, hath no need of that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick which is the only remedy by which he may be cured. We will firſt ſee what ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue there is in this Phyſick for the healing of that Malady; and then ſee how Children are infected with that Malady, that is to be healed with this Phyſick.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:97369:79"/>
               <p>§. 2. Now for the firſt what healing vertue there is in Baptiſm, by the Inſtitution of its Ordainer, for the taking away of ſin and <note place="margin">

               <p>§. 3. I begin with the Scriptures. And the firſt I take notice of to this purpoſe is that exhortation of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Jews, <hi>(Acts</hi> 2. 38.) where he ſpeaks unto them to repent <hi>and be baptized every one of them in the name of Jeſus Chriſt for the remiſſion</hi> (that is, the forgiveneſs) <hi>of ſins.</hi> From whence it is clear, that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm is a Sacrament, whereby Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth and conveyeth remiſſion of ſins to thoſe that are baptized. For elſe, why ſhould he exhort them to be baptized for that end? Why ſhould he exhort them to be baptized for remiſſion of ſins, if remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins were not given in and by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm?</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:97369:80"/>
               <p>§. 4. And of ſo known an efficacy to this purpoſe was Baptiſm in the Apoſtles days, that <hi>Ananias (Acts</hi> 22. 16.) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens <hi>Saul</hi> upon his converſion to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed for this end. <hi>And now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>why tarrieſt thou? Ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins calling on the name of the Lord. Be baptized and waſh away thy ſins,</hi> that is, in order to the cleanſing thee from thy ſins uſe the means which God hath ordained for that end, be baptized.</p>
               <p>§. 5. And hence ſure it is, and as having an apprehenſion, not to ſay experience, which every body muſt needs know St. <hi>Paul</hi> had of the vertue and efficacy of Baptiſmal waſhing towards this cleanſing, that choſen veſſel tells us <hi>(Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25, 26.) that Chriſt <hi>gave himſelf for the Church, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word.</hi> By <hi>cleanſing</hi> the grace of Juſtification is underſtood (1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 7.) where <hi>the blood of Jeſus is ſaid to cleanſe us from all ſin,</hi> that is, to <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie</hi> us, to purchaſe for us, and procure to us the pardon of our ſins. And ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably it here ſignifies: eſpecially being ſet in contradiſtinction to ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and more ſo in the Original than in the Tranſlation, which is, not, <hi>that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it:</hi> but <hi>that</hi>

                  <hi>he might ſanctifi it, having cleanſed it:</hi> that is, that having forgiven its ſins by the grace of juſtification, he might render it holy by the grace of ſanctification, the one as well as the other being applied, conveyed, or communicated to it <gap reason="foreign">

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. TO talk of what God in his <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary grace</hi> can (and it may be hoped will) do for Infants dying unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed is a vain ſtory. For though God can do all he wills, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not that he will do all <note place="margin">We hold the ſame Neceſſity of Baptiſm, that the Fathers held, which is <hi>viâ ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nariâ:</hi> yet <hi>non al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigando gratiam Dei ad media,</hi> no more than the Schoolmen do.

                  </note> he can. And though he hath not tied himſelf to means, yet he hath tied us. And though to expect the end, when we have deſired, and ſought the means, but cannot have it, may be an act of hope, yet when we may have the means, and do deſpiſe it, or neglect, ſtill to hope the end cannot but be an act of preſumption.</p>
               <p>§. 2. And it may be that God, having in his word declared the guilt that lies upon all, hath ſaid nothing as to the caſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants dying unbaptized, on purpoſe the more

               <p>§. 4. Did I ſay <hi>neglect the means?</hi> I doubt I ſhould rather have ſaid <hi>contemn the means.</hi> For how in this caſe to diſtinguiſh between the neglect and the contempt paſſes my underſtanding: eſpecially when I find the uſe of it both in word and writing look'd upon as ridiculous, and accordingly derided and contemned by neglecters of it; who may very well go to hell for their contempt of the means, though their children ſuffer nothing for the want of it: God being more merciful to their children than themſelves are, and not ſuffering the children to periſh through their parents neglect. Which yet
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97369:93"/> methinks, they ſhould have little hope of, when they remember, how in the time of Circumciſion the parallel to baptiſm, the manchild was to ſuffer exciſion, cutting off from his people, that is from the Church of God, and that as being a breaker of Gods Covenant, who was not at eight days old circumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14. who yet might be as little guilty of his Parents fault in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to circumciſe him, as ours can be of any neglect of ours to baptize them. For what could a Jews child do at eight days old towards his own circumciſion, more than the child of a Chriſtian can at the ſame age do towards his baptiſm? I ſuppoſe the ſeverity then threatned to the child, was deſigned chiefly to oblige the parent. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it would have been a great puniſhment to the parent to have his child through his neglect cut off from the communion with the Church, and from the means of grace, and from the hope of glory, if not forthwith from life it ſelf: and no leſs would it be to us to have our children undone for ever through our neglect. O how muſt it not needs make our own hell the more hot, to find our unbaptized children there, if through our neglect of the means ordain'd by God to preſerve them from thence, they ſhould go thither? as, who is infallibly aſcertain'd that they ſhall not?</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:97369:94"/>
               <p>§. 5. And however it may prove at laſt, that our children be ſaved, though they die unbaptized, yet ſince we have no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of that, but rather ſome reaſon to fear the contrary, we ſhall be guilty of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing and damning, though they be ſaved, ſince as to what was to our ſelves, we let them be undone and damned.</p>
               <p>§. 6. I will evidence this by a parallel caſe. There is ſaid to be a thing called an <hi>Extaſie</hi> or Trance, into which people do often fall, ſometimes involuntarily, and ſometimes at their own will; whereof <hi>Bodinus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Bodin. <hi>Theatrum Naturae, lib.</hi> 4.</note> gives ſeveral inſtances. Now all the time that one is in an Extaſie he ſeems to be no other but dead, no ſenſe, no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either of pulſe or heart being perceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in him. Whereupon ſome have been carried forth to burial as dead, who yet were not indeed dead, but in an extaſie, and have revived at, or after their burial; and one inſtance hereof is given in that famous Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Joha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nes Duns Scotus,</hi> who was buried in an extaſie, and revived after burial, though killed after his reviving by his ſtrugling in his coffin for life. Now whileſt one is in an Extaſie he is not ſenſible of any woundings, burnings, or tearings, ſo that ſome of thoſe things, that would at other times take away
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97369:94"/> life, do not kill, ſuch as drowning or hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. An inſtance of the latter whereof hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened not many years ago at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in a Maid recovered to life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hanging, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">A particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whereof was given in a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſet forth at that time.</note> violences uſed to her for her diſpatch after her cutting down. Now put caſe a man is in danger of death by hanging or drowning, and I may, if I will preſerve him from either; (in which caſe that act of charity becomes my duty) if I do not my duty to preſerve him, I ſhall be guilty of deſtroying him, even though it pleaſe God in that inſtant (as I have read it hath happened in both theſe caſes) to caſt him into an Extaſie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him. He might have been hanged or drowned to death for me, who would do nothing, when I might have done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (and ought to have done any thing, that reaſonably I could) to have ſaved him; and ſo I am guilty even of his death, that did not die: juſt as <hi>Eſther</hi> ſhould have been of the Jews deſtruction, had ſhe not done what ſhe could to preſerve them, though they had not been deſtroyed, but <hi>inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and deliverance had ariſen to them from another place,</hi> (Eſther 4. 14.) And juſt ſo, it being in our power to uſe a means
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97369:95"/> for the preſerving of our children from damnation, if we neglect it, we ſhall be guilty of their damning, though they be not damned.

And by this time I hope it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appears, that as upon the account of the Benefits coming to children by Baptiſm there is Reaſon for their baptizing, ſo upon account of the Danger they are in by Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, and the evil Conſequents of it, from which they are wholly, or in a great meaſure reſcued by Baptiſm, there is Need to baptize them.</p>

               <p>§. 2. And firſt, conſidering that there are Benefits derived to us, and deſcending upon us from Chriſt our Head by vertue of our Union with him as Members of him, which we, and our children have need of, and we cannot hope otherwiſe to obtain ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our ſelves or for our children than by Baptiſm, Baptiſm ſeems to be in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect a thing which both we and our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have a very great need of.</p>
               <p>§. 3. To inſtance but in his Influences upon, Care over, and Interceſſion for his Members. How ſhall we partake of thoſe Influences of Grace, which flow from Chriſt to all his Members by vertue of their Union with him, if we be not united to him? How ſhall we come to be any thing bettered by the care of Chriſt over his Members, if we have no fellowſhip with him as Members
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:97369:96"/> of him? How ſhall we be concerned in Chriſts Interceſſions for his Body, if we be not incorporated into it as members of it?</p>
               <p>§. 4. What need then our Children have of Memberſhip with Chriſt in order to their partaking of thoſe Benefits that are derived from him to his Members; that need have they of being baptized into Chriſt, that by their Baptiſm they may be made the Members of Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> inferred a neceſſity of baptiſm to all believers. And others have extended that neceſſity unto Infants; to whom the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians</hi> themſelves have allowed it, though not upon the account of Original Sin, yet for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the kingdom of heaven: whereas our Church takes in both thoſe conſiderations, as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church ever did, in her admiſſion of them unto Baptiſm, and grounds their baptizing upon both, ſtrengthened with Chriſts command here in the Text <hi>to ſuffer little children to come unto him.</hi> So that no baptiſm, no entrance, even for Infants, into the kingdom of heaven; that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97369:97"/> is none according to the ordinary way, whatever there may be extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.

               <p>§. 8. Fifthly, by baptiſm we are <hi>ſaved, (1 Pet.</hi> 3. 21.) But by what Baptiſm? Not any Jewiſh Baptiſm, which was onely the putting away of the filth of the fleſh; But the Chriſtian Baptiſm, which waſheth away the filth of the Spirit, to the enabling of the baptized with a good conſcience to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97369:98"/> God. Now this for the ſaving efficacie of it is compared to the Ark of <hi>Noah.</hi> By the one, as by a means ordained of God for that end a few were ſaved from among the reſt of mankind that periſhed for ſin: and by the other, as a means of Gods ordaining for that end, a few are ſaved from amongſt the reſt of the Sons of men that periſh in ſin. And as, we are ſure, none then were ſaved without <note place="margin">

               <p>§. 8. Again, it is true, Infants cannot of themſelves <hi>come</hi> to baptiſm. Why but yet they may be <hi>brought</hi> to it by others.

               <p>§. 9. It is true again, that they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeek after, nor deſire their own ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm; a thing anciently expected from, and performed by adult Perſons.

And ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this reſpect are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants incapable of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>§. Yea, but they do not repent them of their ſin, Nor is it required of them that they ſhould. The Scripture no where has enjoined them repentance in order unto baptiſm; nor alledged their inability to repent as a bar to their admiſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:97369:105"/>
               <p>§. 5. Indeed we have Scriptures where grown men are exhorted to both together, to repent and be baptized; and where ſigns of repentance were ſhewed by ſuch as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved baptiſm, <hi>Acts 2. 38. Matth.</hi> 3. 6. But ſtill the Perſons both exhorted unto, and ſhewing repentance, were of age both to commit actual ſins needing repentance, and to act that repentance that was needfull for their baptizing. But what is this to the caſe of Infants, who as they are not guilty of actual ſin, ſo they are in no ability for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Where there is no general rule, an argument from particulars is no farther ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative, than to particulars under the ſame circumſtances: which cannot be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt men and Infants, ſo as that what is injoyned to, or performed by the one, muſt be neceſſarily required of, and performed by the other. And ſo ſome mens being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted unto Repentance and Baptiſm both at once, and other mens confeſſing their ſins (as a token of their Repentance) when they were baptized, is no argument, that therefore all Infants muſt do ſo too, or elſe not be baptized: and ſo no Infants bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, becauſe none can ſo do. The caſe, 'tis plain is not the ſame. And ſo whatever want of Repentance, or Non-profeſſion of it may do to hinder <hi>Men</hi> from being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97369:105"/> it can do nothing to render <hi>Infants</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Baptiſm. Who as they have the guilt of ſin brought upon them by anothers diſobedience, without their knowledge, ſo they have that guilt taken off from them by the obedience of another, without their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: which pardon is not onely ſigned and ſealed, but exhibited alſo, and given to them in and by Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>§. 6. And as to the Church, it is true indeed that of Adult ſinners it requires a Perſonal Profeſſion of Repentance before it admit them to Baptiſm. But for Infants that have not ſinned after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, it admits them to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm without any ſuch Perſonal Profeſſion. So there be but a Promiſe made of it for the future againſt the time that it ſhall be neceſſary, by Sureties for the Infants in the Infants names, as the Scripture doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſo much, ſo the Church doth not ſtand upon more.

               <p>§. 5. Other ſome again would anſwer, that Infants have Faith in themſelves, though not in the Act, yet in the Habit, or rather the ſeed and principle of it.</p>
               <p>§. 6. And truly that as God is able to infuſe, ſo the ſoul of an Infant is capable to receive divine impreſſions and illuminations, I think is a truth none will queſtion. And if any ſhould, the filling of <hi>John Baptist</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt from his Mothers womb, and his leaping for joy, at the approach of his Saviour, in his Mothers womb, <hi>(Luke</hi> 1. 15, 44.) would put it out of doubt.

               <p>§. 7. But being under no neceſſity for the ſupporting of the cauſe I maintain, to aſſert theſe grounds, I ſhall no further inſiſt thereon: but to the Objection againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants capableneſs of baptiſm founded in their want of Faith, give my Anſwer, that their not believing is no hindrance to their baptizing.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:97369:108"/>
               <p>§. 8. It is no hindrance to their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even in the judgment of our Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts, who declare it as one Article of their Faith, That all children dying in Infancy (that is before they can act faith in their own perſons, and be believers qualified for baptiſm according to their account) having not actually tranſgreſſed againſt the Law of God in their own perſons are onely ſubject to the firſt death, and that not any one of them dying in that eſtate ſhall ſuffer for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> ſin eternal puniſhment in hell, which is the ſecond death. It is no hindrance then to their ſalvation in their judgment, that they believe not. And why then ſhould it be a hindrance to their Baptiſm? Is more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their baptiſm, than to their ſalvation? to the means, than to the end?</p>
               <p>§. 9. But to make ſhort work, where, or by whom is faith required of Infants in their own perſons to render them capable of baptiſm? What one Text is there in all the Bible that ſaith either in particular, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ſhall not be baptized, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not; or in generall that no perſons whatſoever (whether capable or incapable of believing) ſhall be baptized, but thoſe that believe? Let the Adverſaries of Infants baptiſm produce the place, and the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, I believe, will quickly be ended.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97369:108"/> We, all Paedobaptiſts, will readily yield all that ſhall of right be fit to be yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it, or unto them from it. But if the Scripture ſay no ſuch thing either in words, or in ſenſe, then for ought that as yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears our Infants will be capable of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, though they do not believe.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Why, but doth not our Saviour ſay, (in Mark 16. 16.) <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved: but he that believeth not ſhall be damned?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 11. Yes. And what then? muſt not therefore our Infants be baptized becauſe they do not believe? or not till they believe? No ſuch matter. What is here ſaid that makes believing a condition neceſſarily ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent unto Baptiſm? It is neither ſaid ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, he that believeth not ſhall not be baptized, nor ſo much as affirmatively, he that believeth ſhall be baptized. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and being baptized are made condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not the one of the other, but both of being ſaved. And now, in the name of God, what is here, that can poſſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Infants from baptizing, for want of believing?</p>
               <p>§. 12. Yea, but believing is ſet before baptizing. He doth not ſay, he that is <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized</hi> and <hi>believeth,</hi> but he that <hi>believeth</hi> and is <hi>baptized,</hi> ſhall be ſaved. And what
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:97369:109"/> then? Why then believing muſt go before baptizing; and none muſt be baptized, but thoſe that firſt believe.</p>
               <p>§. 13. To this I anſwer, that if the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things muſt univerſally anſwer to that order of words, wherein the Scripture ſets them down, then Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which is a Fruit of <note place="margin">

Whereas the contrary hereto fell out in the family and company of <hi>Cornelius, Acts 10. 44.</hi> which drew from <hi>Peter</hi> that queſtion in ver. 47. <hi>Can any man forbid water that theſe ſhould not be baptized, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> Then the Ruler (in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 22. ) muſt have given nothing to the poor, till he had ſold all he had, becauſe our Saviour ſaith, (firſt) <hi>ſet all that thou haſt, and</hi> (then) <hi>diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the poor.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:97369:109"/>
               <p>§. 14. But to ſhew the weakneſs of this way of Arguing, it may be proved by this ſame Argument, and from the ſame Text, that Infants ought to be baptized. (And then let them judge what ſtrength there is in this way of Arguing. ) For as our Saviour ſets <hi>believing</hi> before <hi>baptizing;</hi> ſo he ſets <hi>baptizing</hi> before being <hi>ſaved.</hi> And if none muſt be baptized, but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, becauſe believing is ſet firſt; then none muſt be ſaved, but he that is baptized, becauſe baptizing is ſet firſt. And then what better argument can be made for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants baptiſm? They muſt be baptized if we will have them ſaved: becauſe they cannot be ſaved without being baptized: for ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing goes before ſaving. And yet from the ſame Text, and by the ſame way of a guing, it may be proved, contrary to what the Anabaptiſts ſay of the Univerſal ſalvation of all Infants dying before the commiſſion of actual ſin, that no Infants are ſaved but thoſe that believe, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is ſet before being ſaved; and not onely ſo, but whereas it is not ſaid, he that believeth not ſhall not be baptized, it is ſaid, <hi>he that believeth not ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 15. And this may ſuffice to ſhew tho abſurdity of this way of arguing to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:97369:110"/> of things from the ordering of the <hi>words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 16. As to the thing it ſelf, I think it will be granted them, that in Perſons capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of believing or disbelieving the Goſpel, faith, or at leaſt a profeſſion of it, is to go before baptizing.</p>
               <p>§. 17. This we gather from the Apoſtles baptizing no adult perſons that we read of, without ſome evidence given of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
               <p>§. 18. Thus it was with the Converts in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. with the <hi>Samaritans, Acts 8. 12.</hi> with the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. with <hi>Cornelius</hi> &amp; his family, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 44. with <hi>Lydia</hi> and the Gao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14, &amp; 33. with <hi>Criſpus,</hi> and his houſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 8. And is to be ſuppoſed it was ſo with others, of whoſe believing before their baptizing we read not, as of <hi>Gaius</hi> and <hi>Stephanas, 1 Cor. 1. 14, 16.</hi> And this at this day is, and ever hath been, the way of the Churches dealing with adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>§. 19. But the Argument will not hold from Men to Children. It follows not that becauſe men that are capable of believing or disbelieving the Goſpel are not baptized except they make profeſſion of faith; that therefore Infants who are neither capable of believing nor disbelieving muſt profeſs faith,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97369:110"/> or not be baptized. Faith being required of the one, but not of the other.</p>
               <p>§. 20. When the Apoſtle commanded the <hi>Theſſalonians, that if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat,</hi> (2 Theſſ. 3. 10. ) did he mean the Infants ſhould not eat, that could not work? 'Tis plain he required working onely of thoſe, that were able to work, not of thoſe that were unable. So in the caſe in hand, 'tis apparent that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is onely required of men able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and believe, not of Infants neither able to believe nor underſtand. For by the words immediately foregoing, <hi>preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> it is moſt evident, that it is of ſuch perſons onely as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel may be believed or disbelieved by, upon the preaching of it to them, that it is ſaid, <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized ſhall be ſaved: but he that believeth not ſhall be damned:</hi> not of ſuch perſons, as the Goſpel cannot rationally be preached to, in order to the bringing them to believe by the preaching of it, in regard of their incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to underſtand it, and inability to believe or disbelieve it. And ſo Infants are utterly unconcern'd in this Text. And as from it we plead nothing for them, ſo from it can nothing rationally be pleaded againſt them.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:97369:111"/>
               <p>§. 21. I have read that Men muſt be converted, and become as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <note place="margin">Matth. 18. 2.</note> children, (I ſuppoſe for humility and innocency,) that they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdom of God. But I have not read that little children muſt be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and become as Men (for underſtanding or Faith) before they can have entrance in Gods kingdom. A profeſſion of faith by perſons of underſtand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng in the names of the Infants is required by the Church: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that profeſſion it baptizes them. But that underſtanding and faith which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Adult perſons as praevious to their baptiſm, is not by the Church required in Infants as neceſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y to their baptizing. Nor can it be proved that ever it was by Chriſt, or any Apoſtle of his, exacted of them; as it cannot be proved, that ever Chriſt, or any Apoſtle of his, ordered the delay of their baptizing till it might be in them.</p>
               <p>§. 22. And laſtly, if Infants baptiſm be an Apoſtolical Tradition, that is a thing delivered down to the Church to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed in it by the Apoſtles, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Perſons, and as practiced alſo by themſelves, as there is better ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, than there is evidence againſt it, then the thing is out of queſtion. They would never have baptized themſelves, nor
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:97369:111"/> taught others to baptize, ſuch as wanted faith, becauſe incapable of believing, if mere want of faith, notwithſtanding ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity to believe, did render them incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of baptizing. And if not believing did not in the Apoſtles Age and the Ages ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding it make Infants incapable of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm: then can it not make them ſo in ours: there being no more reaſon for the one, than for the other.</p>
               <p>§. 23. And ſo here is nothing in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants themſelves that renders them uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being baptized.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Children not incapable of being baptized in regard of any thing required of them, or to be done to them in Baptiſm.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. SEcondly, There is nothing in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm required of, or to be done unto Infants, which hinders them from it, or renders them incapable of it.</p>
               <p>§.2. Not the <hi>Thing ſignifying,</hi> Water, with the application of it by way of Immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Aſſuſion. They may be <hi>dipped</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to water in caſe of ſtrength; or they may have water poured on them, in caſe of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Not the <hi>Thing ſignified,</hi> The Blood of Chriſt, and the Grace of the Spirit. For what can hinder why they may not be ſprinkled from the guilt of the ſin of their Birth by the blood of Chriſt in the Grace of Juſtification? Cannot the blood of Chriſt ſatisfie for that guilt that lies upon Infants? Or cannot God apply the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made by the blood of Chriſt unto In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants? And what can hinder why they may not be cleanſed from the corruption of their nature by the Power of the Spirit in the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:97369:112"/> Grace of Sanctification? Cannot the Holy Spirit mortifie thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions unto evil, which <note place="margin">Parvulis datur gratia operans &amp; cooperans per ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſmum, ſicut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultis: ſed parvu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis in munere non in uſu. G. Biel in 4 l. Sent. diſt. 4.</note> are in Infants? Or can he not infuſe diſpoſitions to goodneſs, into Infants? Is not the ſpirit of grace able to inoperate the grace of the ſpirit in Infants? Is not he able to give them a temper of heart capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive his Infuſions? Is not he able to make Infuſions of grace into their hearts ſuitable to their temper? No incapableneſs of Baptiſm then in Infants on theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Again, may not children as well as elder perſons, be taken into <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with Chriſt? May not they be incorporated into him? What? no lambs in his flock, but all old ſheep? No little members in his body, but all great ones? No babes in Chriſt, but all ſtrong men? Cannot the water do the ſame for them? Cannot the ſpirit do the ſame in them, to unite them unto Chriſt, that is done by it either for elder perſons to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Union with him? Surely the application of the Water of Baptiſm to their Bodies, does as well ſignifie and declare; and the infuſion of the Spirit of Chriſt into their ſouls, does as well operate, and effect,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97369:113"/> their Union with him, as the Union of elder perſons. For what ſhould hinder? No incapableneſs then of Baptiſm in Infants on this account neither.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Again, look upon Baptiſm as the Door of entrance into the kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſo far are they from being incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that, that they are made a kind of ſtandard to the capacity of others for it. For our Saviour not only ſaith, that <hi>of ſuch</hi> [as infants] <hi>is the kingdom of heaven,</hi> (Matth. 19. 14.) which implies that they themſelves are qualified for it, and have all things required in them for entrance into it: but alſo he ſaith (Matth. 18. 3.) <hi>Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye ſhall not enter into the kingdom of heaven:</hi> which again implies, that Infants are duly qualified for an entrance into the kingdom of heaven (for why elſe muſt others be converted, and become as they are, that they may enter into it?) and not only ſo, but that none ſhall have entrance into it, but thoſe that are ſo qualified for it as they are. And why they that are qualified for entrance into Heaven, ſhould be unqualified for that which gives entrance into it, I ſee not. Is more required to Baptiſm, than to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If not, then no uncapableneſs as yet appears in Infants for Baptizing.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:97369:113"/>
               <p>§. 6. Further, Look upon Baptiſm as the Note and Badge of a Chriſtian, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children are as capable of wearing that as elder perſons. They have witneſſes of their baptizing as well as others. They are received into the ſame Militia of the Lord Jeſus, and have the ſame preſs-mark (if I may ſo ſay) that others have for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. They have his name named upon them, and have their names enrolled with the reſt that are called by his name. And no incapacity is there in them for any thing of this; and ſo none in theſe reſpects for Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Laſtly, look upon Baptiſm as the Seal of a Covenant entred into betwixt them and God, and they are not uncapable of it in that reſpect neither. If they be not incapable of the Covenant, then ſure they are not incapable of the ſeal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. He that has not denied them the greater thing, is it imaginable he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them the leſs? As the Apoſtle from Gods having given Chriſt for us argues to his giving all things elſe to us; <hi>(Rom.</hi> 8. 32.) ſo ſurely may we argue in this caſe, that if God have not made our children uncapable of his Covenant, then he has not made them incapable of the Seal of it. Why man then ſhould be more ſevere to poor harmleſs
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97369:114"/> babes, than God is, I cannot ſee; nor why man ſhould with-hold from them what God has not denied to them.</p>
               <p>§. 8. But perhaps it will be ſaid, that they are uncapable of entring into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: and therefore uncapable of receiving the Seal of it.</p>
               <p>§. 9. Uncapable of entring into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant? Now God forbid. But why ſo? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they can neither ſet any Seal to it; nor engage themſelves by any promiſe to it; nor do ſo much as underſtand any thing of it, eſpecially at the years, or rather days, that they are now uſually baptized at.</p>
               <p>§. 10. But none of theſe hinders their entring into Covenant with God.</p>
               <p>§. 11. Firſt not their inability to ſeal. For Contracts are not always ſealed by both parties at the ſame time. We ſee it ordinarily in contracts made not onely by Princes at greater diſtances of place, but by private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at leſſer diſtance. The contract is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs interpretatively entred by both, at the ſealing of the firſt, and continues firm and binding to the firſt all the while till the ſecond have ſealed alſo, he in the mean time acting nothing to the fruſtrating of it; and there is no new ſealing required from the firſt at the ſealing of the ſecond. Be it then that Infants cannot perſonally ſet their
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97369:114"/> ſeal to the Covenant at their Baptizing, nor till their Conſirming, may not God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet his ſeal to it in the mean time? May not God take them into Covenant with him, and make his promiſe to them, and ſet his ſeal to that promiſe, and bind himſelf to them for the preſent, becauſe they cannot back again do the like at preſent to him, but muſt ſtay either till they can do that (and ſome will never be able to do it) or elſe there muſt be no Covenant betwixt them? ſure no man of reaſon will ſay ſo. O, what a bleſſing 'tis to have God to have given his Covenant to our children, and to have ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſealed it, and to be acting purſuant to it for the good of our children in the mean time till they can perſonally ſeal to their own part themſelves! And O, what a cruelty would it be to ſhut the door againſt ſo great a bleſſing to our children!

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Children not incapable of Baptiſm by any Text of Scripture that forbids it, either directly, or by conſequence.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. ADmit Infants never ſo capable of Baptiſm in all other reſpects, yet if the <hi>Scripture</hi> do <hi>forbid</hi> it, then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes unlawfull for them to have it, and they upon that account become uncapable of it.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Thirdly therefore and laſtly I affirm, that upon the diligenteſt ſearch, that I was ever able to make, I could never find any Scripture that forbad it. Search the Scripture from end to end, and not one Text appears, wherein it is forbidden. As the Antipaedobaptiſts call but for one Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that commands it, and upon that ſay, they will yield to it: ſo on the other hand the Paedobaptiſts call for a Scripture that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97369:117"/> forbids it, and upon that ſay, they will not contend for it. But there is none, no not one: it would elſe have been ſhewn ere this, being ſo much, and ſo long, called for.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Yea, though there be never a Scripture that expreſly, and in terms for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it, yet if there be but one, wherein by direct and evident conſequence it is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, (though our adverſaries will yield no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to all the many Scriptures, from whence we do by good conſequence deduce it, becauſe we produce not a Text, that doth in expreſs terms command it) let it be ſhewn, and we ſhall pay all due reſpect unto it: the Conteſt will inſtantly be given over by us, who ſeek not victory without truth, but truth, whether with, or without victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; we ſhall believe the baptizing of our Infants unlawfull, and upon the account of its unlawfulneſs, believe them uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it.</p>
               <p>§. 4. But if there be no ſuch Text in all the Scripture, as doth ſo much as by conſequence forbid the baptizing of Infants, we muſt then beg to be excuſed, if we hold the baptizing of them lawfull, and upon the account of that lawfulneſs, think them not uncapable of it.</p>
               <p>§. 5. For if <hi>ſin</hi> be <hi>a tranſgreſſion of the law,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> defines it, (1 John 3. 4. )
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:97369:118"/> and <hi>where there is no law, there is no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> determines it, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 4. 15. ) then can it be no ſin, either to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be baptized, or to others to baptize Infants, becauſe no law is by either <note n="†" place="margin"> For therefore any thing is unlawful, becauſe it tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth a law. <hi>W.

               <p>§. 6. And put caſe we ſhould grant, that there were no Text in Scripture where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ground it, yet would it not follow thence, that it were unlawfull. For the mere uncommandedneſs of a thing doth not infer the unlawfulneſs of it: a thing is not therefore unlawfull, onely becauſe it is not commanded. To make a thing neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there muſt be a law for it; and to make a thing unlawfull, there muſt be a law againſt it. But to make a thing onely law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, it is not neceſſary there be any law for
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:97369:118"/> it, it is ſufficient that there be no law againſt it. If then we cannot prove it neceſſary, becauſe the Antipaedobaptiſts ſay we have no law for it, they cannot prove it unlawfull, becauſe we are ſure they have no law againſt it. It remains therefore that it be lawfull; and that our children, upon the account of the lawfulneſs of it, be capable of it.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Why but our Saviour ſets Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before Baptizing <hi>(Matth.</hi> 28. 19. ) ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Diſciples, when he commiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to be his Apoſtles to all the nations of the world, for the gathering of a Church out of it, <hi>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Well, and what then? Why then, ſaith the Antipaedobaptiſt, none muſt be baptized before he be taught, and ſo taught as that they do learn. And this becauſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are incapable of, therefore they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of baptiſm.</p>
               <p>§. 8. This Argument of theirs is like that former, which they drew from our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours ſetting believing before baptizing; which how weak it was I hope I need not ſo ſoon remember you. And granting all they can fairly pretend to from this Text, it will not hence follow, that Infants are unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Baptiſm: as I ſhall hope to make
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:97369:119"/> appear upon a due and through conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words.</p>
               <p>§. 9. Our Saviour here enlarges his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples Commiſſion to go and preach, and make Diſciples, not in <hi>one</hi> nation only, as formerly: but in <hi>all</hi> nations; teaching and baptizing them (ſuppoſe we read the words ſo) Well: what can this mean other, than that thoſe of the nations, that were capable of teaching, ſhould be taught and baptized: not excluding from baptizing, thoſe that for the preſent were onely capable of ſo much diſcipulation (if I may ſo ſpeak) as was performed by baptizing, but as yet were not capable of any teaching. And what makes this againſt Infants Baptiſm? There is not an excluſive Particle in the whole Text.</p>
               <p>§. 10. But to proceed, this we will grant, that if the order of Teaching and Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <note place="margin">See D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi>

But this is not from the naked conſideration of the ſetting of the words, Teaching, and Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing; as if the order of the words were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably to be obſerved in the order of things (and if any have ſo thought and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued,

For as no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult perſon will be brought to be baptized before he be taught what baptiſm means, and why he ſhould be baptized: ſo the Church will admit no Infants to baptiſm, but thoſe that are the children of baptized perſons, or at leaſt are undertaken for by ſuch as are baptized. Suppoſe our Saviour had ſet baptizing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore teaching (as he might, had he pleas'd) and ſaid, <hi>Go ye therefore and baptize all nations in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them what I have commanded they ſhould know and do;</hi> who would have ſcrupled to begin his work with teaching, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the order of the words? as ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that none that underſtood themſelves, would ever be baptized before they were taught. It is therefore not from the order of the words, but from the orderlineſs of the things, which cannot otherwiſe be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but in this way and order, that this courſe is, and muſt, in ſuch caſe, be taken. Now if ſo, then the whole force of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipaed
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97369:120"/> obaptiſts argument from the mere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the order of theſe words (teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet before Baptizing) which yet is all they have in this point to urge from them, is utterly vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>§. 11. But when once ſome in a nation have been taught, and have received the faith, and have been baptized into it, then it follows not, that the ſame courſe muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſtill be taken with every ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>le per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in it, that was proper for, and was taken with the whole of it: but that all that any way, and in any degree, are capable of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, may reſpectively according to their capacity be admitted to it, though they be wanting in ſome thing, which others of greater capacity have, and is requiſite in them, to make them capable of it. And to argue from what is requiſite in <hi>Men</hi> before the converſion of a nation, to what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in children after the nation is converted is fallacious. For it does not follow, Thus it was with the Adult Men of the nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of it were converted: therefore thus it muſt be with the Infant Children of the Nation after the converſion of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: more being required of Men, than of Children; of Men that can receive, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Goſpel, than of Children that can neither reject it, nor receive it. Men are
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:97369:120"/> not to be admitted to baptiſm, but upon thoſe accounts, in reſpect whereof they are to be qualified for it. Children are to be admitted to baptiſm upon thoſe accounts in reſpect whereof they are qualified for it; and not to be rejected upon thoſe accounts in reſpect whereof they are not qualified for it: unleſs it had been poſitively and particularly required of them that they ſhould be ſo qualified, or not be baptized. Why ſhould any require from Infants ſo much as is required of Men to qualifie them for baptiſm, when the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath not required of them ſo much? Why ſhould any make Infants entrance into the kingdom of Heaven, ſtraiter than God himſelf hath made it? Why ſhould any keep them out, whom God has a mind to let in? Why ſhould any keep them from coming to Chriſt, whom Chriſt hath commanded ſhould be ſuffered to come unto him?</p>
               <p>§. 12. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Go teach all nations baptizing them:</hi> but he doth not ſay, Baptize none of thoſe nations before they be taught. Some muſt be firſt taught, that all may be baptized; not none baptized but thoſe that are firſt taught. He ſaith, <hi>teach all nations baptizing them:</hi> but he doth not ſay, whether the teaching, or the baptizing ſhall be firſt. No, he determines neither to be firſt or ſecond, but according as their diſcretion ſhould think fit. He ſays
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:97369:121"/> not ſo much as <hi>Teach</hi> and <hi>Baptize,</hi> but only <hi>Teach baptizing.</hi> Which therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth neither to be firſt, but according as the nature of the things may require, and the condition of the perſons admit.

It is unimaginable. And if this way of arguing be moſt falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and abſurd, as it is, then ſuch is that of the Antipaedobaptiſts; (whereto this is exactly parallel, and every way the ſame) when they argue from the order of the

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:97369:122"/> the words, then <hi>Baptizing</hi> muſt go before <hi>Teaching.</hi> And ſo this Text is ſo far from making againſt Infants baptiſm, that it makes clearly for it, even by the Antipaedobaptiſts own way of arguing.</p>
               <p>§. 14. By which way of arguing, if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for good, it were eaſie to prove that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did firſt baptize his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples before he taught them; becauſe (in <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 4.) his baptizing is ſet before his preaching. For ſo 'tis expreſly there ſaid, John <hi>did baptize in the wilderneſs, and preach the baptiſm of repentance for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</hi> See, firſt he <hi>baptized,</hi> and then he <hi>preached;</hi> and ſo by his example, eſpecially according to their way of arguing, men <hi>may</hi> at leaſt, if yet they <hi>ought</hi> not to be baptized, before they be taught.</p>
               <p>§. 15. And ſo, whereas it is ſaid, that thoſe that <hi>John</hi> did baptize, were ſuch as confeſſed their ſins, yet it may be ſaid, that his baptizing (at leaſt according to their way of arguing) went before their confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. For ſo it follows (in ver. <hi>5th) There went out unto him all the land of</hi> Judea, <hi>and they of</hi> Juruſalem, <hi>and were all baptized of him in the river of</hi> Jordan <hi>confeſſing their ſins.</hi> See <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> firſt ye have his Baptizing, and after, their confeſſing. Which that it was really the Holy Baptiſts order of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:97369:122"/> though it be not concluded from the order of the words, yet may ſeem probable from what was the cuſtom of the Jews, as the learned in their cuſtoms ſay, namely, <note place="margin">See <hi>Dr</hi> Lightfoots <hi>Horae Hebraicae,</hi> pag. 41.</note> to admit men unto Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytiſm or Diſcipleſhip by Baptizing them. Either way our buſineſs is done. For if he did not baptize them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had preached to them, and they had confeſſed to him; then the Argument from the order of the words to the order of the things is not good. But if he did baptize them before his preaching and their confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, then here is a Scripture inſtance of Baptizing before Teaching and confeſſing, which juſtifies our practice, and gives an utter overthrow to the whole <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the Antipaedobaptiſts in this matter.</p>

And ſo our Saviours word here (in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19.) is to be rendred as if he had ſaid, ye have formerly made diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples onely of Jews, now enlarge your pains to the making diſciples of Heathens alſo, and thoſe of all the nations of the world; make even all heathens diſciples.

And ſuch, 'tis known by the rules and practices of the Jews, amongſt whom our Saviour lived, and to whoſe cuſtoms and practices he very much conformed, were not onely men of years, and underſtanding, but their children alſo upon the undertaking of others for them. And ſo by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours order the Apoſtles were to make diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples not onely of the grown men of the Heathens, if they ſhould offer themſelves to diſcipleſhip, but alſo their little children too, if they would bring them alſo to be diſciples to him. And diſciples to Chriſt they might be, by being brought by their parents to Chriſts School, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the relation of his Scholars, though they neither knew their Maſter as yet, any more than any of ours, whom we put to a ſtrange School, do at firſt know their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, whom they never ſaw before; or whom we put to a Maſter, whom they have

               <p>§. 23. 'Tis frivolous to make a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the Verbs, and their ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, as if the firſt ſign fied to teach the faith, and the ſecond to teach manners; the Verbs having no ſuch diſtinct imports in their ſignifications.

               <p>§. 28. And by this time I hope it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that there is nothing in the word of God which renders Infants uncapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized.</p>
               <p>§. 29. And if ſo, then we have enough, though we had no more, for Infants ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm. For Baptiſm being that, by which our children may have ſo much good as we
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:97369:128"/> have ſhewn they may have, in the firſt branch of our Argument; and being that, whereof they have ſo much need, as we have ſhewn they have, in the ſecond branch of it; with what either charity or juſtice can they be denied it? being they are ſo capable of it, as we have now ſhewn them to be in the handling of this third branch. Sure children are not the only perſons in the world that may neither have acts of juſtice nor charity ſhewn towards them? And what ſhould hinder us from doing for them this good, for which they have ſo much need? Neither is the pains ſo great, nor the trouble ſo much, nor the charge ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, but we may afford it them. What will we do for them, that will not do ſo little as this comes to, to baptize them? Are we not free and at liberty to do it, if we will? Is there any reſtraint laid upon us from doing it by the Law either of God, or Man? If neither ſpake for it, as indeed both do, yet to be ſure neither ſpeaks againſt it, and ſo we may do it, if we will. And what can be pretended againſt doing ſo much good, where we ſee there is ſo much need?</p>
               <p>§. 30. Do it then, Brethren, for your Children, becauſe it is ſo much for their good. Do it, becauſe that of that good they have ſo much need. And do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:97369:129"/> it is an act both of Juſtice, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which they are as capable of receiving, as you at liberty for performing. Never ſtand hunting for Scripture for it, ſo long as there is no Scripture againſt it: but reckon it your duty to bring them to Chriſt, whom Chriſt hath permitted to come unto him, and whoſe coming to him Chriſt hath forbidden any man to hinder, ſaying, <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not.</hi>
               </p>

And yet above and beyond all this, I ſhall ſhew you in the fourth and laſt place a <hi>Right</hi> that Children have unto Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, and then it cannot but be a <hi>wrong</hi> to hinder them from being baptized.

But not more fruitful was this Century for Teſtifiers to this Truth, then ſome of the foregoing are barren; not from the rarity of the practice, or opinion of men againſt it, but from the ſcarcity of Writers in thoſe Ages, whoſe works are extant, and from the little or no oppoſition made to it.

Now though it be not expreſſed there were any Infants in thoſe, or any of thoſe houſes: yet firſt it is very ſtrange there ſhould be none in any of them: as if the grace of God had delighted to take place and dwell chiefly in barren families, who ſhould be in leaſt probability of propagating it to poſterity, at a time when its propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems to have been the deſign of all the perſons in the Trinity: and ſecondly, if there we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The word, which in the Engliſh we render <hi>is ſanctified,</hi> is, if rightly rendered <hi>hath been ſanctiſied.</hi> So the Tenſe of the Verb <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§. 4. And from this uſe of the word by the Apoſtle here in this place I preſume it is, that it is ſo ordinary with Eccleſiaſtical Writers to expreſs baptizing by a word that ſignifies to ſanctifie: whoſe ſo expreſſing it is a confirmation of this way of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it.

Hence <hi>Primaſius</hi> ſpeaks of being made members of Chriſt
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:97369:168"/> by the ſanctification of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm. So when St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks of the new born In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants being to be baptized and ſanctified, that is (by the Figure <hi>Hendiadys)</hi> ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Baptiſm. So again ſaith he the rules of the Church do ſorbid baptiſm to be repeated: and to them that have once been ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that is baptized, no hand preſumes to come to conſecrate them over again. So St. <hi>Herom</hi> ſaith <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> preached the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins, that is, that remiſſion which afterward followed upon the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>that is the baptiſm of Chriſt.</hi> Where what he means by Sanctification is plain by what follows a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after. For ſaith he, as <hi>John Bapt</hi> was himſelf the forerunner of Chriſt, ſo was his Baptiſm the leader on unto the Baptiſm of Chriſt. Hence <hi>Tertullians</hi> ſaying
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:97369:168"/> of Infants, that if either of their parents were ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, that is, were a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized Chriſtian, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were holy; namely, ſo far as to be capable of baptiſm (as the children of Parents that were both mere Heathens were not) Candidates of holineſs, that is of baptiſmal Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch as were in the next capacity for baptiſm, and as it were ſtood for it.

That Baptiſm was adminiſtred by none but the Apoſtles or Perſons ordained and appointed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles for that work. Hence it follows, that Infants were baptized, as in the Age, ſo by the Hands, or by the Appointment, of the Apoſtles themſelves. Than which nothing needs be required further for the juſtifying of Infants Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>§. 9. And now it having appeared to be the Cuſtom and Practice of the Univerſal Church of Chriſt to baptize Infants; and that Cuſtom and Practice being grounded on the Tradition, and derived from the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Apoſtles themſelves; it follows
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:97369:171"/> that Infants have as good a Right unto Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm by Preſcription from thence, as any perſon can have to any thing elſe by that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which yet in many caſes is as good as any other.</p>
               <p>§. 10. And now, for Gods ſake, tell me why Infants ſhould now be denied that which they have always had? why ſhould they now be forbidden coming to Chriſt, who in all the Ages of the Church, even up to that wherein the Apoſtles lived have had free acceſs unto Chriſt, and have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to come to him, and that by Baptiſm? Why ſhould we be leſs carefull of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens concerns than in all former ages others have been? why ſhould not we be as vigilant to preſerve their Rights, and this eſpecially, as others before us? We need not doubt their Title nor queſtion their Right, having ſo good a Preſcription for it. Either Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription can give no good Right to any thing, which yet we ſee it doth in many: or elſe children having ſixteen hundred years preſcription to plead for it, have a good Right unto Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>§. 11. And yet is not that all the Right the little Children have unto Baptiſm. For I ſhall now proceed to ſhew you a Third Right, that they have unto it: and that is by the Inſtitution of Chriſt himſelf.</p>

And truly, though the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe hour of its inſtitution be not infallibly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared from the Goſpel, yet from the Goſpel it is moſt evident that it was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt before his reſurrection or paſſion: and then thoſe words in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eath even while <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was yet alive, we read of our Saviours making and baptizing diſciples, that is receiving diſciples by Baptiſm. Which Ceremony yet he himſelf did not,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:97369:173"/> after the taking in of his Apoſtles to be his Diſciples adminiſter by himſelf but by his Diſciples. Now certainly they did it, not of themſelves, but by his Inſtitution; which is nothing elſe but his preſcribing and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the uſe of it to that end whereto it was to be uſed. Whence it is ſaid of thoſe whom his <hi>Diſciples</hi> baptized, that <hi>he</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized them: that being reckoned as done by him, that was done by his appointment. Now if it were practiced by the Diſciples of our Saviour, and by his appointment in his life, then could not thoſe words in <hi>Matth.</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> be the Inſtitution of it, which were not ſpoken by him till after his death. But that muſt be the time, when ever it was when our Saviour inſtructed, empowred and appointed his Diſciples to baptize, and the words what ever they were whereby he did inſtruct, empower, and appoint them to do it, muſt be the words of Inſtitution.

               <p>§. 6. But how then ſhall we know what the Inſtitution of Chriſt was, and ſo judge by that, what Perſons are to be baptized? I anſwer, very well: and by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two things. The firſt is, what was in uſe among the lews before our Saviours time. The ſecond is, what has been the uſe among Chriſtians ſince the time of our Saviour. And if we find the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e agreeing with the other, and anſwering to it as face anſwers to face in water, then there can be no other judged, but that as the one did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the other, ſo our Saviour did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain it ſhould be; appointing that what was in uſe before ſhould be ſtill in uſe as it was,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:97369:175"/> ſave where he did improve or alter any thing therein. Now whether we look at what was in uſe among the Jews before our Saviours time, or what has been in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians ſince h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s time, we ſhall find all making for Infants Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>§. 7. And by the way you are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that our Saviour, when he put an end to the Moſaical Obſervances, did not wholly evacuate, and make null, all that was in uſe and practice among the Jews, and introduce a perfectly new platform of his own, wholly other, in all both the Subſtance and circumſtances of it, from what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but did take much of what he found ready to his hand among them, that was uſefull to him, and did continue it ſtill in his Church, onely accommodating and fitting it to his own purpoſe, and improving and heightning it in the uſes and advantages of it to his Diſciples. This the Learned ſhew by inſtances <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> Quaere of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing of Infants, §. 5.</note> in ſundry particulars. And thus particularly it was in the inſtitution of Baptiſm. That before the time of our Saviour, even from ancient days, had been in uſe among the Jews as one Ceremony among others of the initation of Diſciples into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God; as the moſt Authentick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:97369:175"/> of the Jewiſh Antiquities do teſtiſie. And that our Saviour, leaving off the other two which were in uſe together with it, namely Circumciſion and Sacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fice, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and ordain ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d be the ſole and ſingle Ceremony of Initiation or Admittance of Diſciples into his Church. And here by the way I cannot let paſs, without a remark, the mercifulneſs of our Saviour towards mankind, in the continuation of this, and diſmiſſion of the other two; in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Sacrifice was chargeable, and Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was painfull, he was pleaſed to lay down them, and continue onely Baptiſm, which was neither charge nor pain.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Now it is moſt certain that before our Saviours time thoſe that became Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes to the Jewiſh Church, were admitted into it by three things, <hi>Circumciſion, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> which laſt was ſo <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsary,</hi> that though one were circumcized, yet if he were not alſo baptized, he was not a true Proſelyte, but a Gentile ſtill.

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:97369:178"/> in as much as our Saviour made no alteration in this particular in the Jewiſh Baptiſm, therefore Infants are by his Inſtitution to be baptized. And, that in all thoſe paſſages of Scripture, which ſpeak of admitting any to be diſciples to Chriſt, or of any's being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by baptiſm to be his Diſciples, there, if Infants be not by ſome Circumſtance ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily excluded, they are in the deſign and by the Inſtitution of our Saviour to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
               <p>§. 14. As, for inſtance: when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour enlarging his Diſciples former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſaith to them, <hi>Go and make Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all nations baptizing them,</hi> who, that remembers but what perſons were admitted to be made Diſciples before our Saviours time, namely Infants as well as others; and conſiders but withall that ſince his time alſo Infants as well as others were in the firſt Ages of the Church, and ever ſince admitted to Diſcipleſhip by Baptiſm, who I ſay, that but remembers and conſiders this, can judge any other, but that our Saviour did in his deſign extend his words to all thoſe that he did not exclude, even to Infants alſo as well as to others; and that his Diſciples did alſo accordingly ſo underſtand him; and baptize Infants; and deliver Infants Baptiſm down as a thing to be for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:97369:179"/> in the Church even by his Inſtitution: of which their ſo doing there can no other probable account or reaſon be given.</p>
               <p>§. 15. Put caſe, whereas of three things formerly in uſe for the admitting of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, viz. <hi>Circumciſion, Sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,</hi> our Saviour did lay aſide the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Circumciſion and Sacrifice, and did continue onely the later, namely Baptiſm; (put caſe I ſay) he had continued Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion to be the onely Ceremony to be uſed in his Church for the admitting of Diſciples, and had laid aſide Sacrifice and Baptiſm; and in ſtead of ſaying, <hi>Go ye therefore, and make Diſciples of all nations, baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. had ſaid, <hi>Go ye therefore, and make Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eiples of all nations, circumciſing them,</hi> &amp;c. who that remembred that Infants as well as others <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleets</hi> Vindicat. of the A. B. of <hi>Cant.</hi> p. 107.</note> had uſually in that caſe been circumciſed, would ever have interpreted his words to the excluding of Infants from Circumciſion, or ever have once imagined, or phanſied any other, but that children ſhould now, and henceforth, as well as formerly, be circumciſed. Even ſo now our Saviour having diſcontinued Circumciſion and Sacrifice, and continued Baptiſm alone, to be the Sacrament of the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:97369:179"/> Initiation of Diſciples into his Church, who, that remembers that it was the uſe before our Saviours time to admit Infants into the Church by Baptiſm, can imagine any other, but that his mind was that they ſhould ſtill be ſo admitted; or but rationally phanſie, that in ſaying, make diſciples of all nations <hi>baptizing them</hi> he meant to exclude Infants from Baptiſm. If Infants ſhould have come in, had he ſaid <hi>Circumciſing them,</hi> as undoubtedly they would (who would ever once have diſputed it, or made any queſtion of it?) then they ought to come in now that he hath ſaid, <hi>Baptizing them.</hi> For the caſe is equall on both ſides, one as well as the other being a Ceremony of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Diſciples to Proſelytiſm before his ſaying thoſe words; and there being as much reaſon for the one as for the other, the very ſame for both. Which one conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, if reaſon might take place, were enough to end the controverſie, and carry the Cauſe for Infants Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>§. 16. And thus again, when in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Text our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not,</hi> in as much as the coming he there ſpeaks of is a coming to be his Proſelytes, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his Diſciples, (as appears by what

               <p>§. 17. And in that it is not ſaid that our Saviour did baptize them, but onely took them up into his arms, and laid his hands upon them and bleſſed them, it will not hence follow that he did neither baptize them, nor appoint, nor allow of their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing. For to argue that he did not do, nor appoint, nor allow of this or that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not ſaid, that he did do, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, or allow of it, is not good: there is no conſequence at all in it.

As therefore it doth not prove that his Diſciples were not baptized, becauſe it is not written, that he did baptize them; ſo it doth not prove, that he did not baptize theſe Infants, becauſe his baptizing of them is not written.</p>
               <p>§. 19. Again, who doubts but that our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf was <hi>circumciſed?</hi> And yet it is no where expreſſed in Scripture that he was circumciſed. It is ſaid indeed, that <hi>when eight days were accompliſhed for the circumciſing of the Child, his name was called Jeſus,</hi> Luke 2. 21. But it is not ſaid, that upon the eighth day, when it was come, he was circumciſed. As therefore it doth not prove that our Saviour was not circumciſed, becauſe his being circumciſed is not written: ſo doth it not prove that theſe Infants were not baptized, becauſe it is not written that they were baptized by him.</p>
               <p>§. 20. Laſtly, who doubts, but that our Saviour did at his laſt Supper communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with his Diſciples, eat the bread, and drink the cup with them? And yet it is no where written that he did ſo. It is ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:97369:181"/> that <hi>he bleſſed the bread, and brake it, and gave it to his Diſciples, and ſaid to them, Take, cat.</hi> But it is not ſaid that he himſelf did eat it. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

(And his ſaying, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 29. that he would not thenceforth drink of the fruit of the Vine, does but give reaſon to ſuppoſe it, and is no affirmation of it). As therefore it doth not prove that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did not communicate with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, becauſe it is not expreſſed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that he did it: ſo it doth not prove, that he did not baptize theſe Infants, becauſe it is not written that he did baptize them.</p>
               <p>§. 21. Rather, the very great favours that he is written to have ſhewed theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as to take their part againſt his own D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:97369:182"/> they ſhould, when they came or were brought, be admitted, in ſaying, <hi>Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not.</hi> And would he deny them that one, that had vouchſafed to them all the reſt?</p>
               <p>§. 22. And if he did not baptize them himſelf, that is no wonder. For he did not conſtantly baptize himſelf all that he admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be his Diſciples. Though from <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> ſaying, <hi>I have need to be baptized of thee,</hi> I may ſuppoſe that he did baptize ſome; and if no more, yet at leaſt his Twelve diſciples, by whoſe hands, after that he had baptized them, he did baptize others. Whence it is ſaid, (John 4. 2. ) <hi>that Jeſus himſelf baptized not, but his Diſciples.</hi> Though he made Diſciples, which imports his admitting men to be Diſciples, and receiving them to proſelytiſm by the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereof, which was Baptiſm (whence he is as well ſaid to have <hi>baptized,</hi> as to have <hi>made more diſciples than John, i. e.</hi> to have made by baptizing) yet the particular act of baptizing them, was a thing, which he did moſt uſually, if if not conſtantly, tranſact by the hands of his Diſciples. And by their hands he might baptize theſe Infants, though he did not uſe his own hands to that work.</p>

What other can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but that he gave them over to his Diſciples to be baptized with their hands, who had vouchſafed them the Impoſition of his own hands? For though it be not ſaid <hi>he baptized them,</hi> yet it is ſaid he did that, that was the next to it, and the utmoſt that he can be conceived to have done to any, whom he did not baptize himſelf, but gave over to his Diſciples to baptize; he <hi>laid his hands upon them,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed them;</hi> and by thoſe actions did as it were conſign them unto baptiſm, mark them

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:97369:183"/> is not eaſie to ſay. And on the contrary, that thoſe that were converted, did deſire the baptiſm of all theirs as well as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is moſt evident, becauſe we read of the baptizing of whole Houſes conſequent to the converſion of the ſingle Maſter, or Miſtreſs of thoſe Houſes: for inſtance, the Jaylor, and <hi>Lydias, Acts</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>§. 25. And touching this latter, the houſe of <hi>Lydia</hi> it may not be amiſs to make one obſervation before we paſs, namely that, though it be ſaid that the houſhold of <hi>Lydia</hi> was baptized, yet it is not ſaid, that they or any of them, beſide <hi>Lydia</hi> her ſelf believed, profeſſed, or ever ſo much as once heard the Goſpel preached to them. Now hereupon I would ask our Adverſaries, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may receive any thing as a Divine Truth, that is not written in the Divine Word, or we may not?</p>
               <p>§. 26. It is their intereſt to ſay we may not: that being the main, if not the whole, of all the ſtrength they have againſt our Plea for Infants Baptiſm, that it is not ſaid in the Scriptures that Infants ſhould be baptized, or were baptized, whence they weakly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that Infants Baptiſm is not either in the Doctrine or Practice of it to be received. Now if in purſuance of their Intereſt they ſhall ſay we may not: then I ſhall infer

And ſo here will be a Scripture Example of Perſons baptized, without any either belief, or profeſſion, or knowledge, or ſo much as hearing of the Goſpel; their believing, profeſſing, knowing, or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, being not to be received as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth, becauſe it is not written in the Divine Word. And then a Perſons not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, profeſſing, or knowing the Goſpel will be no hindrance to his baptizing. And ſo our Infants cannot be denied baptiſm upon that account. Why man not our Infants be baptized, though they neither believe, nor profeſs, nor know the Goſpel, upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of believers for them, as well as the Houſe of <hi>Lydias</hi> was: who, for any thing that appears in Scripture to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, nei her believed, nor profeſſed, nor had any the leaſt knowledge of the Goſpel before they were baptized, but, as it may be ſuppoſed, were admitted to baptiſm through the Miſtreſs of the Familie's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking for them, and becoming a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother as it were unto them.</p>

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:97369:184"/> they ſay we may receive ſomething as a Divine Truth, which is not written in the Divine Word, then I infer on the other ſide, that it can be no hindrance to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Infants Baptiſm as a Divine Truth, that it is not written in the Scripture. For if we may receive it as a Divine Truth, that the Family of <hi>Lydia</hi> had both heard, and did believe, and at leaſt make a profeſſion to believe the Goſpel, before they were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, (and if they did not, then let the Antipaedobaptiſts tell us, if they can, upon what account or ground they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed) though no one ſyllable of all this be written of them in the Divine Word, then may we as well receive it as a Divine Truth, either that there were Infants among thoſe baptized ones, or that the Apoſtles did ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize other Infants, though their baptizing be as much paſſed over in ſilence, and unmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as the hearing, believing or profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Lydias</hi> Family before they were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, here is: eſpecially being there are ſuch other poſitive grounds, as we have ſhewn, whereupon to receive it.</p>
               <p>§. 28. And here I muſt profeſs my ſelf too ſhort ſighted to be able to foreſee what ſhift our Adverſaries can find out, to evade and avoid the force of this <hi>Dilemma;</hi> by which their whole way of arguing againſt
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:97369:185"/> us a <hi>non ſcripto,</hi> from our having, as they pretend, no Scripture for what we profeſs and practice in this caſe, ſeems to be broken and overthrown.</p>
               <p>§. 29. And by this time hope it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to every one, that, not onely by the Conſtitution of this particular Church, but alſo by Preſcription from the Cuſtom and Practice of the Catholick and Primitive Church, and alſo by the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt himſelf our Infants have a Right to be baptized. And if ſo, then they cannot, without injury, and injuſtice to them, not to ſay alſo diſobedience to the Order of this preſent and particular Church, Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the practice of the Catholick and Primitive Church, diſagreement with the inſtitution of Chriſt, and reſiſtance to the Command of Chriſt, be denied Baptiſm. For what elſe can it be, to hinder thoſe from coming to him, whom he hath commanded to be ſuffered to come?</p>
               <p>§. 30. And ſo I have diſpatcht the Fourth and laſt Branch of my Argument for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Baptiſm; and have ſaid all I intended to ſay by way of Confirmation of the Point. What remains to be ſaid will be matter of Uſe and Application.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Infants Baptiſm Lawfull, though there were neither Command for it, nor Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of it.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. BY what I have ſaid in the former part of this Diſcourſe, I hope I have ſufficiently evidenced the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> at leaſt of Infants Baptiſm; I will now go on to conſider and anſwer Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; and that will ſtill be a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it; and that being but obtained, the <hi>Need</hi> they have of it, and the <hi>Benefit</hi> they may have by it, will be ſufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to their baptizing, though they had no poſitive <hi>Right</hi> unto Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>§. 2. The Antipaedo baptiſts main ground, on which they build their Opinion of the Unlawfulneſs of Infants Baptiſm, taken in its full ſtrength lies thus. That which no one Text in all the Scriptures either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or gives example of, that it Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But in all the Scripture there is no one Text, that either commands, or gives an example of Infants Baptiſm, Therefore it is Unlawfull.</p>
               <p>§. 3. In contradiction to this ground.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:97369:186"/> and to ſhew the falſeneſs of it, I thus argue againſt the firſt part of it. If nothing be lawfull to be <hi>practiced,</hi> but what ſome Text of Scripture doth command or give exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of, then nothing will be lawfull to be <hi>believed,</hi> but what ſome Text of Scripture doth affirm. For it is as neceſſary that we ſhould have a Scripture Affirmation for what we <hi>believe,</hi> as a Scripture Command or Example for what we <hi>practice.</hi> And this I think no Antipaedo baptiſt will deny. And if ſo, then many things that we now believe and practice, and ſhall become Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, if we do not believe and practice them, ſhall become unlawfull to us, becauſe there is in all the Scriptures no one Text that affirms the one, or commands or gives example of the other: as I ſhall ſhew in both particulars.</p>
               <p>§. 4. And firſt in matters of <hi>Faith.</hi> Firſt, that the <hi>Son, as God,</hi> is <hi>equall</hi> to the Father: this we believe, and I hope the Antipaedobaptiſts do not disbelieve it. And yet there is no one Scripture that doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirm it. So, that <hi>as Man,</hi> he was <hi>circumciſed:</hi> this we believe, and our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipaedobaptiſts do not deny, and yet (as we have already noted) there is no one Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that doth expreſly affirm it.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Again, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt is</hi>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:97369:186"/> 
                  <hi>God:</hi> this we believe, and I would hope our Antipaedobaptiſts did believe it too. And yet there is no one Scripture that doth expreſly affirm it. Alſo that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father and the Son:</hi> this we believe; and our Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts do not, that I know, deny it. And yet there is no one Text of Scripture that doth expreſly affirm it.</p>

               <p>§. 7. Fourthly, even but this, to add no more, that it is the duty of <hi>Children to love their Parents;</hi> this we believe, and ſure the Anabaptiſts will not deny it. And yet where is there one Text in all the Scripture that doth expreſly affirm it.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Now if we do, and may believe theſe things, and ought to believe them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſufficient ground for our belief of them;
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:97369:187"/> even good Conſequence drawn from ſome one or more Texts of Scripture compared together, though no one Text of Scripture doth ſingly, and alone in <hi>terms</hi> affirm them: then may we as well practice ſome things, which no one Text of Scripture doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly command, or exemplifie, ſo long as we can deduce that practice from any one, or more Texts of Scripture compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the contrary Doctrine, which is the Antipadobaptiſts ground for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of Infants baptiſm, is erroneous and abſurd.</p>
               <p>§. 9. Again, in matters of <hi>Practice,</hi> That <hi>Women</hi> as well as Men ought to receive the <note place="margin">

               <p>§. 10. So that the weekly <hi>Lords day</hi> is to be ſanctified, or kept holy; this we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and practice, and the Antipaedoba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts too. And yet there is no one Text of
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:97369:187"/> Scripture that commands it. Nor is there in the Scripture any example of its ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but what may agree to any other beſides it. It may indeed be ſhown, that ſome where they did meet on that day, and perform holy duties: but it may alſo be ſhown that other where they did meet and perform holy duties on other days: and if one conclude for the one, then will the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conclude for the other: and ſo we ſhall either have all holy days, or none: and then not that, for any either command that enjoyns it, or example that infersit.</p>
               <p>§. 11. So that <hi>Men or Women</hi> may be baptized either naked or cloathed we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and the Church hath practiced. And the Anabaptiſts, I ſuppoſe, do believe and have practiced both ways. And yet there is no one Text of Scripture that commands baptizing either way: neither is there an example of any perſons being either way baptized extant in Scripture. Of the going of ſome into the water, of their being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized therewith, we find mention: but of their going into it, or being baptized with it, naked or clothed, there is nothing men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. So that let the Antipaedobaptiſt ſay, which way men and women ſhould be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, whether naked or clothed, yet ſtill here will be a circumſtance at leaſt in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice

               <p>§. 12. Now if both we, and the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paedobaptiſts, do rightly believe, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully practice, what we believe of, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in, theſe things, without any Scripture command, or example, to enjoyn, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us; then their aſſertion of the Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of what is neither commanded, nor exemplified in Scripture is erroneous, and full of abſurdity. Which yet I ſhall further make to appear upon other accounts.</p>
               <p>§. 13. I think any rational man will grant, that there is no more neceſſity of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Divine <hi>Command</hi> for every thing we take up into our practice, then there is of having a Divine <hi>Countermand</hi> for the laying down of any thing practiced by a Command Divine. Yea of the two there is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we ſhould have an expreſs command from God to leave off what himſelf had
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:97369:188"/> once commanded, than there is to have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the beginning of a practice never commanded by him. For that which he never expreſſed any command for, may yet be agreeable to his <hi>ſecret will,</hi> and ſo not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lawfull, but acceptable to him. And this may be ſhewn in ſundry caſes; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the Jews ordaining and keeping the Feaſts of <hi>Dedication,</hi> and of <hi>Purim.</hi> But the leaving off to do what God hath once commanded, cannot but be againſt his <hi>revealed will,</hi> and ſo neither acceptable to him, nor lawfull: unleſs there be good and competent ground for the <note place="margin">What may be a ſufficient ground in this caſe, See Dr. <hi>Stilling fleets Irenic. part. 1. c. 1. S. 3. p. 12, 13.</hi>
                  </note> leaving it off, and a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence of the ceaſing of that obligation to it, which was once by vertue of a Divine command upon it. If then there may be any thing ſhewn, which was once expreſly commanded by God, and practiced in obedience to that command, whoſe practice is now left off; and by the Anabaptiſts themſelves, without any expreſs command to the contrary, and yet lawfully, then it will follow, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly. I hope, that there may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing practiced by us, which yet never was in Scripture expreſly commanded us: and ſo Infants Baptiſm may be lawfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:97369:189"/> though never expreſly in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture commanded. Now I inſtance in the <hi>Sanctification of the ſeventh day,</hi> and in the <hi>Circumciſion of Infants at eight days old:</hi> both expreſly commanded, both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly practiced; and both now left off to be obſerved, and yet without any expreſs command for the diſobſerving of either. I ſpeak all this while of <hi>things ſacred,</hi> and not merely <hi>civill</hi> or <hi>naturall.</hi> And ſay an <hi>expreſs command,</hi> becauſe I find nothing elſe will ſatisfie. Elſe enough hath long enough, and often enough been offered to ſhew the lawfulneſs of Infants Baptiſm. Which if nothing elſe had been offered, is ſufficiently proved by this Argument follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which they are as far from being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, as they are from being able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>§. 14. That which is no ſin cannot be unlawfull. Infants Baptiſm is no ſin: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not unlawfull. That Infants ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm is no ſin either to the Baptizer, or Baptized is plain, becauſe it is no tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any Law. For that which is no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of a Law is no ſin. Infants Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm is no trangreſſion of any Law. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no ſin. That that can be no ſin, which is no tranſgreſſion of any Law is moſt evident, not onely becauſe St. <hi>John</hi> hath
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:97369:189"/> poſitively defined <hi>ſin</hi> to be <hi>the tranſgreſſion of a law, (1 John 3. 4.)</hi> but alſo becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath concluded negatively, that <hi>where no Law is, there is no tranſgreſſion,</hi> (Rom. 4. 15. ) And theſe men that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Infants baptiſm unlawfull, which muſt needs ſignifie its being ſinfull, I wonder how, or whence they come to know it, and conclude it. Sure they do not know more than St. <hi>Paul</hi> did. And his Rule to know ſin by, and ſo what is lawfull, and what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, was the Law. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by the Law is the knowledge of ſin,</hi> (Rom. 3. 20. ) And, <hi>I had not known ſin, but by the Law:</hi> for <hi>I had not known luſt,</hi> i. e. had not known it to be a ſin, <hi>except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> (Rom. 7. 7. ) So then Infants Baptiſm being no tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any law; becauſe there is no law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; for there can be no tranſgreſſion of a law which is not; it muſt follow that it can be no ſin, and ſo cannot be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>§. 15. The Scripture, I ſay, being laid down to be the Rule of <hi>Lawfull</hi> and <hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Infants Baptiſm no Addition to the Word of God. The Scriptures objected on that account conſidered and cleared.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. YEa but, argues the Antipaedobaptiſt, Nothing is lawfull that is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in Scripture. Infants Baptiſm is not commanded in Scripture. Therefore it is unlawfull. But why is nothing lawfull that is not commanded in Scripture? Becauſe the doing of any uncommanded thing is an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word; &amp; all additions to the word are forbidden by the Word: and ſo unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Now the Scriptures that forbid all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to the word are many, <hi>Deut. 4. 2.</hi>
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:97369:190"/> 
                  <hi>Deut. 12. 32. Prov. 30. 6. Iſa. 1. 12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. But what if not every doing of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded thing be an adding to the word? Or what if the baptizing of an Infant (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it never ſo much uncommanded) be no ſuch addition to the word, as is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den? Why then Infants Baptiſm, for all its ſuppoſed uncommandedneſs, may be no ſin. And ſo the whole force of the Argument falls to the ground. But becauſe the beſt trial hereof will be a particular view of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures objected on this account, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſtantly addreſs my ſelf to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of them; and from that view I ſhall hope to find, as that not all doing of a thing beſide the word, is an addition to the word, ſo that Infants baptiſm is none of thoſe cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable additions to the Word, which are forbidden by it.</p>
               <p>§. 3. And the firſt is that in Deut. 4. 2. <hi>Ye ſhall not add unto the word which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you, neither ſhall you diminiſh ought from it, that you may k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord your God, which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. To this I anſwer firſt that <hi>the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> here forbidden cannot poſſibly be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as to make it unlawfull to do any thing, even appertaining to the worſhip of God, which is not expreſly commanded.
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:97369:191"/> in the word of God. And that will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to overthrow their ground, and ſecure Infants Baptiſm from the guilt of unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For it is evident that the <hi>word</hi> here commanded to Iſrael, to <hi>which they were not to add, and from which they were not to diminiſh,</hi> are <hi>the Statutes,</hi> and <hi>the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> taught them to do <hi>(ver. 1.)</hi> namely, in this Book of <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy,</hi> and the ſeveral chapters and verſes of it: and however in the whole book of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law. Now it is moſt certain, that thoſe <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>judgments,</hi> as they lie diſperſed in the whole book of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, do reach unto all ſorts of duties of common life, towards our ſelves, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our brethren, as well as of worſhip towards God. If then all doing any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded thing be an adding to the word, and that adding to it which is here forbidden by it, then all other uncommanded actions, as well as uncommanded acts of worſhip and ſervice towards God, muſt hereby be forbidden, and ſo be unlawfull: and we muſt no more do any action of common life, than any act of worſhip and ſervice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, but what is expreſly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the word, for fear of incurring the guilt of adding to the word, and doing that which is unlawfull. And then there will be
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:97369:191"/> Abſurdities enow follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereupon, as has upon <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> Eccl. Politie. Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> ſeveral accounts, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, been ſhown by ſundry of our Divines. But if the Prohibition of adding to the word here, be not, for the abſurdities conſequent thereunto, to be extended unto the actions of common life, then it is not to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the actions of religious ſervice. For the ſame addition that is not to be made to the one, is not to be made to the other: and the ſame diminution that is not to be made from the one is not to be made from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There being no diſtinction in this caſe made betwixt the one and the other, it muſt be applied to both or to neither. And either there ſhall no uncommanded actions of common life be lawfull, or elſe ſome acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of religion may be lawfull, though not commanded, and the doing of them no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the word. And if ſo, then Infants Baptiſm may be lawfull enough, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any thing that here is ſaid to the contrary, and not be found any addition to the word.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Secondly, I anſwer, that, this way of Interpreting this Text, ſo as to render all uncommanded either civil or ſacred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions unlawfull being overthrown, there
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:97369:192"/> are other commodious rendrings of the Text, which may fully ſpeak the ſenſe of it, and yet render Infants Baptiſm not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>§. 6. One is that of <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>To diminiſh</hi> is not to do that which is bidden. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diminuere eſt non facere quod jube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; addere, aliter quam eſt juſſum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</hi> Grot. <hi>in loc.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>To add</hi> is to do otherwiſe than 'tis bidden. To do <hi>what</hi> otherwiſe? Why that ſure which is forbidden. His word is not <hi>(aliud) another thing,</hi> as if the doing of any other thing, than what was bidden, were in his ſenſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word which is forbidden: but it is <hi>(aliter)</hi> otherwiſe, clearly ſhewing his ſenſe of the Adding here forbidden to be the doing of what was bidden, <hi>otherwiſe</hi> than it was bidden to be done. Now what is this to Infants Baptiſm? How can our doing of it be a doing otherwiſe than is commanded, and ſo an adding, in his ſenſe to the word, if in the word there be nothing at all commanded that concerns it. And if it be not all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, how is it poſſible we ſhould do it otherwiſe than 'tis commanded, and ſo be guilty of adding to the word, in his ſenſe, by the doing of it?</p>
               <p>§. 7. Another is that of Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> who makes the paying of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

Now what is this, <hi>you ſhall fulfill all my commandments, and not diſobey any of them, either by doing what I forbid, or by leaving undone what I command, or by doing any thing that I have commanded otherwiſe than I have commanded otherwiſe than I have commanded it,</hi> to the buſineſs of Infants Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm?

               <p>§. 8. A third is that of theirs, with whom I agree, that interpret the <hi>not adding</hi> here forbidden of not adding any thing to the word of God as the word of God which was never ſpoken by God.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is done by diminiſhing the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of it, reckoning that for merely Humane, which is Divine. This is a thing which we are wrongfully charged by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to be guilty of, becauſe we own not the Apocryphal Books as the divinely inſpired word of God, but as the writings of unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired men. But they are juſtly guilty of it, that look upon the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as a <hi>dead letter,</hi> and <note place="margin">Caſpar Swenck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldius <hi>docuit vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cale verbum tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam literam oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidentem rejiaien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſſe: ſolo ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu nos contentos eſſe debere.</hi> Alſted. <hi>Prolegom.

               <p>§. 9. And accordingly to <hi>Add</hi> to the

And this is done two ways. Firſt, by adding words to the word of God. This he ſhould be guilty of that ſhould put any words into the Bible more than Originally were there; or ſhould put into the Tranſlation of the Bible more then is in the words or ſenſe of the Original.

This we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Papiſts to be guilty of in making the Apocryphal Books of equal Authority with the Canonical. Which yet cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have been written by a Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; nor to have been given by God as a Law of Faith but onely written by Men as a Direction for Life.</p>
               <p>§. 10. If then for the Baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:97369:194"/> we pretend no word of Gods not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by him; if into his word we have put no words of our own, or any mans elſe, nor have given to any thing not written by him an equal Authority with his word, then we are not, we cannot be guilty of that Adding to the word of God which here is prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. None ſure is ſo weak as to think the baptizing of a child to be the adding of words to the word of God.</p>
               <p>§. 11. And what hath been ſaid of this Text will ſerve in anſwer to other Texts of the ſame import. Such as <hi>(Deut.</hi> 12. 32.) where it is ſaid, <hi>What thing ſoever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you, obſerve to do it, thou ſhalt not add thereto, nor diminiſh from it.</hi> What <hi>thing</hi> ſoever, that is, as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§. 12. And this is agreeable to thoſe Texts, where this uniform obſervance of the then ſetled rule is more explicately ſet down. As (in <hi>Deut. 5. 32.) ye ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to do therefore as the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, you ſhall not turn aſide to the right hand or to the left.</hi> And <hi>(Deut. 28. 14.) Thou ſhalt not go aſide from any of the words, which I command thee this day to the right hand or to the left, to go after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gods to ſerve them.</hi> And <hi>(Joſhua 1. 7.)

               </p>
               <p>§. 13. Now what is this to Infants Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, ſuppoſing it utterly uncommanded? How is the baptizing of an Infant, a not doing as the Lord hath commanded? or a going aſide from any of his words? or a turning from them to the right hand or the left? What one word of our own, or anies elſe, have we added to his to bring it in?
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:97369:195"/> what one word of his have we left out, that elſe might have given a ſtop to our doing of it? what one word of his have we changed to make the eaſier way for its intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, or continuation? what one thing required by him have we turned from, and let alone unperformed, that we might do that in the ſtead of it? yea, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, how doth not our doing of it hold proportion <hi>with</hi> his word, and ſo can be no violation <hi>of</hi> his word? In ſhort, when it can be made appear that the baptizing of Infants, is the putting of words into <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, then we ſhall, and till then we ſhall not yield, that it is that adding to the word of God, which God by <hi>Moſes</hi> in this Text for bad.</p>
               <p>§. 14. Such again is that ſaying of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur,</hi> Prov. 30. 6. <hi>Add thou not unto his words leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a lia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> What can this mean other, than that no man ought to add any of his own, or others words to the word of God, as if God had ſpoken them, whereas he never ſpake word of them? This whoſoever he be that doth, he muſt needs be found a liar, when God comes to reprove him. But what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof can he be liable to for adding to his words, that hath added nothing to them? Or how can he be found a liar upon the account
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:97369:195"/> of adding to Gods words, who doth not affirm, God ever ſaid one word more than he hath ſaid?</p>
               <p>§. 15. And now what is this Text, or any thing that can be inferred from it, to our pleading for Infants baptiſm? Have we for the introducing or defending that practice, inſerted into the word of God any words of our own, pretending them to be his words? Let the book be ſearcht, and the words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and let the ſhame of ſuch adding light upon the doers of it. But if we do no ſuch thing, if we have added no one word concerning this to Gods Words, then can this Text make nothing at all againſt us, who have done nothing of that which is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by it?</p>
               <p>§. 16. Indeed from ſuch words of God as are expreſſed in Scripture, we draw ſuch <hi>Conſequences</hi> as naturally flow from them being rightly interpreted. But this is no adding to the words of God. This is but what we are enabled to by the example of our Saviour and his Apoſtles: who prove things not expreſſed in Scripture by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences deduced from Scripture: and by ſuch proving juſtifie a rational collection from the word to be no culpable addition to the word, which is the thing that this Text for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids.</p>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:97369:196"/>
               <p>§. 17. Yea but, do we not find the Jews ſeverely reproved again and again for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming uncommanded acts of worſhip, of <hi>which,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I commanded th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§. 19. But let us a while conſider the expreſſion, <hi>which I commanded them not, nor ſpeake it, neither came it into my heart, or mind.</hi> What is this but a <hi>Meiôſis,</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating in a milder expreſſion a ſeverer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdiction? <hi>which I commanded not,</hi> that is, which I have moſt ſtrictly forbidden, as abhorring it, and abominating it in my heart.

Which yet I hope they will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, and I am ſure they cannot juſtly charge us with all. What we do in this, we do it ſimply and ſincerely, walking accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our light, and acting according to our conſcience, without hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>§. 25. But put caſe we do allow them their own ſenſe of all thoſe Texts, which they bring to prove the unlawfulneſs of any thing that is not commanded in the word of God <hi>(viz. Deut. 4. 2. &amp; 12. 32. Prov. 30. 6, </hi> &amp;c. ) yet ſtill it will not follow, that thoſe Texts which were given under, and as a rule for the Legal Diſpenſation, and reached to all the moſt minute parts and circumſtances of Gods worſhip, which were every one under the penalty of a curſe to be punctually obſerved, are now in force un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and as rules for the Oeconomy of the Goſpel. For that will be to bring back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and make neceſſary all the former le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal adminiſtrations; becauſe there muſt be no Diminutions from Gods Word. For by what Texts of Scripture are forbidden all Additions to the word of God, by the ſame Texts are forbidden all Diminutions from his Word. And if we muſt do nothing more than has been commanded, becauſe we
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:97369:199"/> muſt not add; then we muſt do nothing leſs, becauſe we muſt not diminiſh. And ſo we muſt fall again to Circumciſion, and all the outdated ſervices of the Law, and in plain terms, turn Jews.</p>
               <p>§. 26. If it be ſaid, that the not doing of things now, that were commanded then, is no Diminution, becauſe there has been a <hi>diſannulling of the Commandment going befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And thoſe Texts muſt be in force both ways, or neither way; reaching unto all Diminutions, or elſe not extending unto all Additions. Beſides, if the Commandment be diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And how there ſhould either from, or to, a no Commandment be made any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, or addition, is not ſo very eaſie to underſtand. How can any thing be done either more or leſs than is commanded, when there is no command? And a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand diſannulled is annihilated as to all exiſtency of being a command: and is now none.</p>
               <p>§. 27. If it be replied that the equity of thoſe Texts remains ſtill. And that therefore as nothing was to be done in the time of the Law, but what was written in the Book of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:97369:199"/> the Law: ſo nothing is to be done in the time of the Goſpel, but what is written in the Book of the Goſpel. I anſwer, No. Thus far the equity of them remains, that what is commanded in the Goſpel, be done as it is commanded: and what is forbidden, be forborn. But it doth not reach to the making of every thing unlawfull to be done, which is not particularly preſcribed in the Goſpel. Becauſe there is a great diſpa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§. 28. In the Legal Oeconomy parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular order was given for all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial as well as ſubſtantial parts of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But in the Oeconomy of the Goſpel no ſuch particular Order has been given. And ſo the caſe is not equal. And therefore the Argument from the one to the other, from a compleatly ſetled adminiſtration to an adminiſtration not compleatly ſetled, is not good.</p>
               <p>§. 29. Find us in the Goſpel ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat a Platform not onely for all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials, but alſo for all Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, as was under the Law, and we ſhall not think fit, upon the account of the equity that is pleaded from thoſe Texts, to add any thing thereto.

               <p>§. 6. And what ſaith he to it? Why by way of Conceſſion he ſaith, Our Lord doth indeed ſay, Do not hinder them from coming to me. And what then? Why then let them come when they are grown up to ripeneſs of years. Yea, but if they muſt ſtay ſo long before they be baptized, they will not be little ones when they come to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm; and ſo will not be concern'd in this Text, which ſpeaks of the coming not of Adult perſons, but of young children unto Chriſt. He ſaith not, Suffer thoſe that are Adult, but <hi>Suffer little children</hi> to come unto me. And his ſaying, <hi>Suffer little children</hi> to come unto me, imports his mind to have them come, and his readineſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them at their coming to him, even
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:97369:206"/> when, and whilſt they are little children. And what man of judgment, would ever have interpreted our Saviours ſaying, <hi>Suffer the little children to come unto me and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them not,</hi> at a time when little children were brought to him, and hindred, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to him ſo little, as if he had by ſo ſaying meant, Suffer theſe, which now are little children, to come to me hereafter, when they ſhall be men? that is, as much as to ſay, Suffer them not to come to me now: which is to command the very ſame thing which at the very ſame time he rebuked his Diſciples for going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to do; and contrary to his preſent acting, who even then turn'd them not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him, but took them up into his arms, and laid his hands upon them, and bleſſed them.

Did they nothing of whoſe doings nothing is written? who are at leaſt one half of the whole number of the Apoſtles. And if they did any thing, as ſure enough they would be doing, they might as well do that, baptize Infants, as any thing elſe, for any thing, that is written, And where we find Infants Baptiſm in a Church planted by an Apoſtle, as in <hi>Muſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And there is as good proof, that they did not any thing elſe, of all thoſe things which our Saviour comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, as that they did not that: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no more is written of any thing elſe that they did, than of that, which is juſt nothing at all.</p>
               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:97369:208"/>
               <p>§. 3. And they of whoſe doings any thing is written, did they no more, than juſt what was written? Were they ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in keeping, and publiſhing Diaries of all their actions? Not a word ſaid? not a deed done, but what was book'd down? How many perſons do you read of that were baptized by <hi>Paul</hi> in all that time that he continued preaching the Goſpel, and planting the Church of Chriſt at <hi>Rome?</hi> And do ye think none were baptized by him, or at his command all the while? Can there be a Church founded, and formed up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out baptiſm? And if any were baptized, where is it written in Scripture, who, what, or how many they were? Again, do ye think the Saints at <hi>Rome</hi> did never comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate the death of Chriſt in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Euchariſt? If yea, what men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is there of it in Scripture? In what book, chapter, verſe is it to be read? No doubt both the one and the other Sacrament was by <hi>Pauls</hi> inſtructing and ordering re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived there: and yet is the Scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly ſilent as to any ſuch thing. And who now will be ſo ſilly as from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſilence to draw a negative concluſion, and ſay no ſuch thing was done there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture ſays nothing of the doing of it. The like may be ſaid of other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:97369:209"/> and the Churches planted by them.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Unleſs therefore that which is written were a perfect regiſter of all that was done by all, and every one of the Apoſtles, as it is not of the doings of either all, or one half, or any one of them, it cannot be proved, that no one of them did any thing, or appointed any thing to be done, (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to baptize Infants) becauſe it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in thoſe few ſcanty memoires, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations rather than relations, of ſome acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſome few of them, written for the moſt part occaſionally, which are come to our hands, that any one of them d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§. 5. And that they did it, or however ſo far delivered their mind concerning it, that done it was, and upon the account of their authority is moſt credible. Becauſe the Practice thereof is, and has been, looked on in all the Ages of the Church, ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, wherein they lived, as a <hi>Tradition</hi> of theirs. And that Tradition from them is as credibly avouched to us, as their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe ſeveral Fpiſtles and Goſpels, which we receive for their writings, and look upon as the word of God. And we may as well receive the one upon that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:97369:209"/> as the other, and with as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reject the one as the other. We have the Teſtimony of the Church for the one, and we have but the Teſtimony of the Church for the other.

And ſo the matter is at laſt come to this, that either we muſt have no new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament Scriptures, or elſe we muſt have Infants baptiſm. The new Teſtament, and this Sacrament of it, muſt for ought I ſee, ever ſtand and fall together: both ſtanding upon one bottom, Catholick Tradition, which muſt bear up both, or neither; not being able to ſupport the one, if it cannot ſupport the other alſo.</p>

I will not ſay but that ſome few (one or two, for many hundreds of years) may have thought it not neceſſary to be adminiſtred ſo ſoon as in the prime of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, unleſs in caſe of death.

               <p>§. 7. And what ever reaſon we find any of the Ancients had to think it fitter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it, I am of opinion we ſhall never find the unlawfulneſs of it to have been any of their reaſons. <hi>Tertullian</hi> thought the deferring of it <note place="margin">

That the Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might not be brought into danger of failing in their undertaking, by their own mortality, or the Infants untowardneſs. The deferring of it might then be prudential, but that makes not the doing of it unlawfull. And if he thought it prudential to defer it, others as judicious as he have thought it no leſs prudence to haſten it. And ſo his opinion in that caſe ſignifies nothing as to our preſent concern.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Perhaps ſome might think it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to defer it, to avoid the expoſing of ſo ſacred an adminiſtration to the jeers of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ſcoffers. <hi>Dionyſius the Areopagite</hi> mentions <note place="margin">

And no doubt there are now ſuch in our days as think that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice ridiculous enough. But ſtill be it as ridiculous as any has imagined it, that renders it not unlawfull. And if every thing muſt be laid by that any will think ridiculous, we ſhall have little left, either of our Worſhip or Doctrine. When ſome heard of the Reſurrection they mocked <hi>(Acts</hi> 17. 32.) But, as wiſe and pious perſons will not be jeer'd out of a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice that is ſolemn and ſerious and of weighty concern by the raillery of a few aieny-brain'd phantaſticks, ſo it is beſide the queſtion in hand; and if any have thought fit to defer it on that account, that is no argument of the unlawfulneſs of it.</p>
               <p>§. 9. Some perhaps imagining the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract made by the Perſons themſelves, though never ſo young, but three or four years old, ſo they could but anſwer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to what was to be required of them in order to their baptizing, would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be accounted by themſelves the more obligatory, and have ſtronger impreſſions upon them than if made by others, have
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:97369:211"/> thought it fitter to defer it for a while. I diſpute not the prudentiality of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: but onely ſay that the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, be it never ſo great, of its defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring longer, can infer no unlawfulneſs on its doing ſooner. And it ſeems to me, that there are more weighty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations inclining to, and preſſing for the haſtening of it, than that, or any I have yet met with for the deferring, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the generality have this way ſhew'd themſelves inclined by baptizing their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren whileſt Infants.</p>

               <p>§. 1. YEa, but is it not the expreſs <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Church</hi> that Holy Scripture containeth all things <hi>neceſſary to ſalvation?</hi> Yes. And what then? Is Infants Baptiſm therefore unlawfull? No ſuch matter. It follows not.

               <p>§. 2. But what then follows! Why this. That, ſuppoſing Infants baptiſm were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther read in Scripture, nor could be proved thereby, it were <hi>not to be believed as an Article of the Faith,</hi> nor were the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of it to be thought <hi>neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But ſure a thing is not therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, becauſe it is not to be received as an Article of the Faith; or becauſe its belief is not neceſſary to ſalvation.

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:97369:213"/> though ſome think not concluſive of the Point, yet that acute Divine as well as Heroick prelate, A. B. <hi>Laud,</hi> thought to be a direct proof, and <hi>neer an expreſſion in Scripture it ſelf.</hi> 'Tis Acts 2. 38, 39. <hi>Then</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> For <hi>the promiſe is unto you, and to your children,</hi> &amp;c. But how doth this prove Infants Baptiſm? Why, let that learned Man tell you in his own words. <q>For when St. <hi>Peter</hi> had ended that great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of his, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. he applies two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts unto them, <hi>ver.</hi> 38. Amend your lives, and be baptized, and you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt. And then <hi>ver.</hi> 39. he infers, For the Promiſe is made to you, and to your children. The Promiſe; what Promiſe? What? why the Promiſe of Sanctification by the Holy Ghoſt. By what means? Why, by Baptiſm. For 'tis expreſly, Be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and ye ſhall receive. And as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, This promiſe is made to you, and to your children. And therefore <hi>A. C.</hi> may find it, if he will, That the Baptiſm of Infants may be directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of Scripture.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:97369:213"/>
               <p>§. 5. But <hi>Infants</hi> are not named here. True; Yet <hi>Children</hi> are. But thoſe <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> might be <hi>men.</hi> Yes, and they might be <hi>Infants</hi> alſo. I conceive the word is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of neither, but incluſive of both. Unleſs any will ſay that the Infants were no children; or that the promiſe that was made to the children as well as perſons of the then preſent hearers, was made onely to ſuch of their children as were men and not Infants; which is eaſilier ſaid, than proved. For the Apoſtle ſays <hi>to your children;</hi> that is all of them; not <hi>onely ſome of them;</hi> all of them being capable of the thing prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſed, and none of them being exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted from the benefit of the promiſe. And where God has enlarged the bounds, why ſhould man encloſe the Common? where God has made a reſtriction? Where God has been kind, why ſhould Man become cruel, and ſhut out Infants from the benefits of a promiſe, when God has opened a door wide enough to let them in to it?</p>
               <p>§. 6. It is true, the word <hi>Children</hi> is not always to be underſtood of <hi>Infants,</hi> but ſometimes of <hi>Men:</hi> and as true it is that it is not always to be underſtood of <hi>Men,</hi>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:97369:214"/> but ſometimes of <hi>Infants:</hi> and as true again it is that ſometimes it includes both. For when <hi>the children of Iſrael went into the midſt of the ſea upon the dry ground,</hi> (Exod. 14. 22.) Were thoſe <hi>children</hi> all <hi>men?</hi> Had they no <hi>Infants</hi> among them? Did they leave them any where behind them? I think it will not be ſaid. In as much then as no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is here made, it includes the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant</hi> as well as <hi>Men children</hi> of Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ael. And the rather becauſe where God would have it to ſignifie <hi>Men</hi> excluſively as to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, himſelf makes a reſtriction. As in Exod. 12. 37. <hi>And the children of Iſrael journeyed from</hi> Rameſis <hi>to</hi> Succoth, <hi>about ſix hundred thouſand on foot, that were men, beſide children.</hi> No diſtinction then being made of the children into Men chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Infant children, it is by Analogy of Scripture, as well as Judgment of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be underſtood of both. And if it be to be underſtood of both, then what right the men had to Baptiſm by this Text, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants had the ſame, and were to be baptized for the remiſſion of ſins, and reception of the Holy Ghoſt as well as they. And admit, we ſay, <hi>you,</hi> and <hi>your children,</hi> does intend the <hi>then preſent Jews,</hi> and <hi>their poſterity;</hi> yet ſure none can think the Apoſtle meant that the promiſe did belong to their poſterity
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:97369:214"/> onely, and not to their preſent children alſo. For why ſhould it belong to thoſe that after ſhould be their children, and not to thoſe that then were? Why ſhould theſe be skipt over and the other taken in? And would not their after children be once in a ſtate of infancy as well as their preſent? Would they not be children before they could be men? And at what period of their age muſt their right to the pomiſe firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence? When muſt they begin to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive of the Holy Ghoſt? Here's no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction or limitation made as to times, any more then as to perſons; to ſhew that both then, and afterward, to all that were, or ſhould be their children, as ſoon as ever, and as long as ever any ſhould be in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the promiſe did belong.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Again, admit we interpret the children as meaning onely ſuch of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whether then or after, as were in that capacity that the perſons then preſent with the Apoſtles, and to whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake, were: ſtill the buſineſs will be done, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually. For St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake to that whole multitude that was come together upon the noiſe of what was happened unto the Apoſtles. And to them he ſaid, <hi>be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:97369:215"/> every one of you.</hi> So then every one of the then preſent multitude was capable of baptiſm. Now is it imaginable that ſo great, and ſo confuſed a multitude coming together on a ſudden accident, could conſiſt all of perſons qualified for age and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in principles of Chriſtianity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Antipaedobaptiſtical meaſures of capability to receive baptiſm? What? were they all Adult perſons? no children? no infants, at leaſt of three, four, five, or ſix years old, among them? We may make an eſtimate of the matter by what we daily ſee amongſt our ſelves on like occaſions. Where is it poſſible to find a Fair, or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, or other ſolemn convention of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark in which ſome of age under the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipaedobaptiſts ſtandard of capacity for ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing ſhall not be immixed? eſpecially if that convention be ſudden, and tumultuary, as this was, when a whole Town flocks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as when a fire happens, or any ſray is fought, or game is plaid, or ſhow is ſeen. What running is there on ſuch occaſions of mothers, and ſervants after their children, to ſecure them from the injuries of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and ſave them from being trodden under foot? And we can imagine nothing leſs then a miracle in it if this aſſembly were
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:97369:215"/> not ſuch. And if ſuch it were, then what would we have more than an exhortation of the Prince of the Apoſtles with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all his Coapoſtles to ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to <hi>be baptized every one of them?</hi> What is this leſs than a Precept for Infants baptiſm, And though none of them were ſucklings, yet if any of them were Infants (&amp; infancy is a ſtate of ſome latitude) though able to run about and play, yet unable ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally to <hi>profeſs repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards God, and</hi>

               <p>§. 8. Yea, but theſe words are ſpoken to perſons capable of repenting. And they onely are bidden to be baptized, who are capable of ſo doing.</p>
               <p>§. 9. I anſwer, Firſt it is plain the words were ſpoken to a confuſed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and it cannot be proved that there were none in it but ſuch as were ſo capable; no demonſtration can be made of it, that there were no Infants mixed with it. And
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:97369:216"/> therefore when the Apoſtle ſays to that multitude, <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> it cannot be proved that he had thoſe onely of them to be baptized, which were capable of repenting.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Secondly, the words were ſpoken of Perſons capable of receiving the Holy Ghoſt: but their children were capable of that: and therefore of baptiſm the means to make them partakers thereof. And ſure their inability to repent, could not render them incapable, unleſs they had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>§. 11. Thirdly, the Reaſon inducing the Jews to be baptized, is applied to their children as well as to themſelves; which were needleſs, if their children were not capable of baptizing, as well as themſelves. Be baptized every one of you. Why? For the promiſe is made to you and to your children. No need of mentioning the childrens right to the Promiſe, if that did not give them a right to the Means. The Argument as applied to the Parents lies thus. If the promiſe belong to you, then the means. But the former does belong to you. Therefore the latter. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be baptized, which is the means, that you may receive the Holy Ghoſt, which is the Promiſe. And lies it not juſt ſo as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to their Children? If the promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to your Children, then the means alſo belongs to them. But the Promiſe belongs to them; for it is made to them as well as unto you. Therefore the means alſo belongs to them. And therefore let your children have the means, that they may not want the grace, let them be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed that they may receive the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>§. 12. Again, that which he would have them baptized for, namely remiſſion
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:97369:217"/> of ſins, is ſufficiently I hope proved to be needful for children as well as parents. And where there is the ſame need, why ſhould we not think he deſigned the ſame help? When he bad the Parents be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed for the remiſſion of ſins, can it be thought his meaning was that the children ſhould rather go without remiſſion, than have baptiſm? as if he had ſome compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion indeed for the parents, but none for the children.</p>
               <p>§. 13. But if he meant their child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>en as well as themſelves ſhould be baptized, why did he not ſay, Be baptized both you and your children, but onely be baptized your ſelves, without any mention of their children. I anſwer, It was needleſs ſo to ſay, becauſe as one that well underſtood the <hi>Genius</hi> of that people, he knew that they would look upon their children as heirs of the promiſe, as well as themſelves, and ſo to be as capable of, and to have as good right to the means, that would make them parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers of the promiſe, as themſelves; and becauſe he intended particularly to urge that reaſon for their baptizing, which would be as appliable to their children as to themſelves, and which they accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:97369:217"/> obſerving the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom <note place="margin">He that would ſee this Text further open'd and urged, may conſult Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen's</hi> Precept for the Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</note> of their nation to circumciſe, and baptize the children as well as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, would apply unto them.</p>
               <p>§. 14. And thus I have ſhewn the Practice of this Church to baptize Infants not to be inconſiſtent with that Article of the Church which is urged againſt it. And I hope I have ſufficiently anſwered the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipaedo baptiſts Arguments againſt the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Infants baptiſm, and defended it againſt them.</p>

               <p>It is ſaid indeed, Acts 1. 15. <hi>That in thoſe days </hi> Peter <hi>ſtood up in the midſt of the Diſciples.</hi> But how does it appear, that any Women were among them at that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly? They are not mentioned. And the word <gap reason="foreign">

The nature of common words being ſuch, that before their determination by any maſculine or feminine adjective, they are applicable to either ſex, but after their determination to either, they are no longer common to both. Had it been ſaid to be of the doubtfull gender, ſomething might have been inferred from that. But as the word is not of that gender, ſo <hi>H. D.</hi> expreſly ſaith it is of the common gender.

                  <hi>himſelf,</hi> which is of the maſculine gender, and not of the feminine, and in propriety of ſpeaking denotes the male and not the female ſex. So that that Text which is onely expreſs for

                  <hi>mens</hi> receiving the Sacrament, can be no expreſs command for <hi>womens</hi> receiving it alſo.</p>
               <p>And whereas he ſaith, there is the ſame word uſed in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28.

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. THe remaining part of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, wherein I will not be long, ſhall be ſpent in a threefold addreſs by way of <hi>Reprehenſion, Caution,</hi> and <hi>Exhortation: Reprehenſion</hi> of ſuch as ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize not their Infants; <hi>Caution</hi> againſt the ſeductions of Antipaedobaptiſts; and <hi>Exhortation</hi> to the baptizing of Infants.</p>
               <p>§. 2. And firſt, if it be ſo that little children are to be ſuffered to come to Chriſt, and ought not to be hindred from coming to him, then do they deſerve a ſharp rebuke, that will not ſuffer them to come, but hinder their coming. Hath Chriſts ſo much tenderneſs of heart towards your Infants hardened your own hearts againſt them? What a cruelty is this to them, to debar them from, and deprive them of, that Remedy for their native Infirmity, which the Phyſician of ſouls hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:97369:222"/> for them! Do ye love to ſee them wallowing in the blood of their nativity, unwaſhed therefrom in the Laver of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation? Is natures filth ſo amiable in the eye of any pretending to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? What a preſumptuouſneſs is this in you to let them live, and venture their dying, in a damnable eſtate, And if they be not damned, they have more to thank the mercy of their God, then the care of their Parents; they might have been dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for all you, you reſolved to venture both theirs, and your own damnation too, rather than have them baptized, though you knew baptiſm to be the means, the onely ordinary means there is, whereby they might be ſaved. What ſhall I call it in you? pride? or perverſeneſs? that you ſo contumaciouſly and contumeliouſly oppoſe and confront your private novel conceit, to the judgment and practice of Chriſts whole Catholick Church. Yea, what is it? croſs-grainedneſs or rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs againſt the Lord Chriſt himſelf, to have no regard to his word, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his reaſon, but oppoſing your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution againſt his reaſon, and your will againſt his word, to hinder little children from coming to him, and forbid their coming, though he hath ſaid, <hi>Suffer the</hi>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:97369:222"/> 
                  <hi>little children to come unto me, and forbid them not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. Secondly, are little children to be ſuffered to come to Chriſt? and ought they not to be forbidden coming to him? then, my Brethren, beware of giving ear to the contrary Infuſions of Antipaedobaptiſtical Seducers. O let no man whiſper into you any doctrine, that contradicts the Command of Chriſt, diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and croſſes the practice of the Univerſal Church of Chriſt. O conſider not what they ſay now, but what Chriſt ſo long ago hath ſaid, and let his word be of more prevalency with you, than the words of any heretical Seducer. O regard not what they do now, but what the Church of Chriſt hath ever done, and let her judgment be of more power with you, than the Opinion of any Schiſmatical Separatiſt. O think not that an upſtart generation of men not heard of in the world till many hundreds of years after Chriſtianity had been planted and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the world, are the onely men in the world that have the priviledge of diſcerning the truth. But <hi>ſtand ye in the ways and ſee, and ask for the old paths, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:97369:223"/>
               <p>§. 4. Laſtly, are little Children to be ſuffered to come to Chriſt? and ought not their coming to be forbidden? Suffer then, I beſeech you, Brethren, a word of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. Be perſwaded to bring, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your little children to come to Chriſt. Do ye not ſee Chriſt calling little children to him? And how can ye then forbear bringing them unto him? Do ye not hear him pronouncing them ſuch as the kingdom of Heaven conſiſteth of? and how can ye then any longer forbear entring them into his kingdom? Do ye not obſerve him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that little children be ſuffered to come to him? And how can ye then have the hearts to hinder them from coming to him? O ſuffer little children to go to their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who hath his arms wide open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them! O forbid not Infants coming to Jeſus, who hath his hands ſtretched out to bleſs them! O bring your children, O carry your Infants to Chriſt, who for their ſalvation did himſelf become an Infant, and paſs through the ſtate of Childhood. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be made partakers of his grace by being baptized with water, who, that they might be made partakers of his glory, was baptized with blood. Conſider the <hi>Benefit</hi> your children may have by Baptiſm, and let that move you to have them baptized.
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:97369:223"/> Conſider the <hi>Need</hi> your Children have of Baptiſm, and let that excite you to their baptizing.

Conſider your Childrens <hi>Right</hi> to Baptiſm, and let that prevail with you not to ſuffer them to go unbaptized. Shall the <hi>Conſtitution of this particular Church</hi> be of no force to move you? Shall the <hi>Practice of the Catholick Church</hi> have no power to work with you?

And though this place were laid by, as likewiſe that of his
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:97369:230"/> in <hi>Levit.</hi> yet whileſt his 14 Homil. on <hi>Luke</hi> of unqueſtion'd Authority ſhall be extant, there will be a witneſs of <hi>Origens</hi> to be produced for Infants Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Laſtly for <hi>Cyprian;</hi> his not urging it as an Apoſtolical Tradition or Precept doth not prove it was none. However his delivering his Judgment for Infants baptiſm is a ſure evidence, that he thought neither Scripture precept, nor Apoſtles practice, nor Church Tradition was againſt it. And it cannot be thought a private opinion, which was ſo early concluded in a <hi>Council</hi> of no fewer than 66 Biſhops. And though <hi>H. D.</hi> meets with no ſuch Council, nor can tell where it was held, yet St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doubtleſs was ſatisfied concerning the truth of it (and St. <hi>Hierom</hi> too) or elſe he would never have appealed to its Authority in the caſe. Nor does St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> mentioning it to be defined in a Council prove it no Apoſtolical Tradition, becauſe it was delivered for an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical tradition before that Council Nor
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:97369:231"/> was it properly Infants Baptiſm that was defined in that Council, but whether In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants might be baptized before the eighth day.

Nor do I find it ſo much contradicted by his great Maſter <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> whom he ſo much reverenced, who diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Inf.

            <p>One thing more I ſhall beg the favour of ſaying, and then conclude the Readers trouble; and that is, that <hi>I have not urged all the Arguments</hi> that are, or might be, inſiſted on in this diſpute: ſo that if all I have ſaid on theſe grounds ſhould chance to ſignifie nothing, yet ſtill is the cauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſperate, nor deplorable; there being behind <hi>Reſerves of other Auxiliary</hi> forces for its ſuccour and ſupport. But why then did I not inſiſt on them? Partly becauſe I thought what <hi>I have ſaid</hi> to be <hi>enough,</hi> and was loth to be troubleſome with more: and partly becauſe <hi>thoſe Arguments</hi> have already <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxter, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens. Sydenham, Geree, Wills,</hi> &amp;c.</note> been managed <hi>by other Writers</hi> with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and dexterity: ſo that it ſeemed needleſs for me to concern my ſelf in them. As for thoſe I have uſed, they are <hi>the ſame</hi> moſtly that were uſed by Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond;</hi> which becauſe I thought very good, yet as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by them, not ſo well adapted to vulgar capacities, by reaſon of the too much <hi>abſtruſeneſs</hi> of the language of the one, and too much <hi>floridneſs</hi> of the ſtyle of the other, as to do that good on <hi>ignorant ſouls,</hi> which they intended, therefore I have ſent
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:97369:233"/> them abroad again, in a vulgar dreſs, and country habit, accommodated for language and ſtyle, as near as I could, and the matter would bear, to mean capacities, ſo as to be intelligible by the ignoranter ſort, (who have moſt need of inſtruction, as being moſt liable to temptation, and whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, conviction, and ſatisfaction I have chiefly, and even almoſt ſolely, aimed at in theſe Papers) yet <hi>Adding</hi> withal ſome things of my own, and ſomewhat <hi>Improving</hi> what was theirs. And if I have at any time exalted my Pen, it has been merely for the refreſhment of <hi>ſome Readers,</hi> who would elſe have been tyred with too long a continuation of one ſtrain, and that too but the dull hum of a Country drone: and for that, if it be criminous, I beg, and hope the Readers pardon.</p>
